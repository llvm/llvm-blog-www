<p>Welcome to the one hundred and sixteenth issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly  newsletter (published every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and  related projects. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by <a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex  Bradbury</a>. Subscribe to future issues at  <a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org</a> and pass it on to anyone else you think may be   interested. Please send any tips or feedback to <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly</a> or <a    href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury</a> on Twitter.</p>  <p>The canonical home for this issue <a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/116">can be found here at llvmweekly.org</a>. </p> <a name='more'></a> <h3>News and articles from around the web</h3><p>If you're a student and would like to get paid to work on an LLVM-related  project over the summer then do consider <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5450930363301888/">applying for Google Summer of Code  with  LLVM</a>. More details about Summer of Code are available  <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/">here</a>. The deadline for  applications is this Friday, March 25th at 1900 GMT. I'd also encourage you to  look at <a href="http://www.lowrisc.org/docs/gsoc-2016-ideas/">lowRISC's project  ideas</a> if you have an interest  in open source hardware.</p><p>Stephen Kelly has written about his <a href="https://steveire.wordpress.com/2016/03/19/aaargh-aaa-right-good-and-hygenic/">new Clang-based tool for porting a C++  codebase to use  almost-always-auto</a>. As was pointed out on Twitter, Ryan Stortz from Trail of Bits has a tools that  removes auto and does <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/clang-tidy-audit">roughly the opposite</a>.</p><p>Honza Hubička has written up his experiments of <a href="http://hubicka.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/building-libreoffice-with-gcc-6-and-lto.html">building LibreOffice with  GCC6 and  LTO</a>. This includes a comparison to a build using LLVM and Clang.</p><p>Nick Clifton has shared an update for February and March <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2016-03/msg00164.html">on the GNU  toolchain</a> that may be of  interest.</p><p>The developer of the Capstone disassembly framework and the Unicorn  multi-architecture simulator is running a funding campaign for the <a href="http://www.keystone-engine.org/">Keystone  multi-architecture assembler framework</a>. Like  Capstone, this will build on LLVM but also <a href="http://www.keystone-engine.org/docs/beyond_llvm.html">aims to go beyond it</a>.</p><h3>On the mailing lists</h3><ul><li><p>Ehsan Amiri has shared an <a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/096901.html">RFC on a change in the InstCombine canonical  form</a>. In the  ensuing discussion, the question of the current state of the typeless pointer  work was raised <a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/096928.html">and  answered</a>.</p></li><li><p>Sean Silva has shared some <a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/096879.html">recent performance observations about LLD with  --build-id</a>. Adding support for this option has added a measurable slowdown which should be  considered when reviewing comparisons with other linkers from before it was  added.</p></li><li><p>I normally prefer to link to mailing list threads where there has already  been some discussion or attempts at answers, but I think this one is worth  some more eyeballs. Jia Chen is interested in <a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/096851.html">the tradeoffs in LLVM using  more sophisticated pointer  analyses</a>. There are no responses at the time of writing, but it seems an interesting  question.</p></li><li><p>Huw Davies has proposed a <a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/096762.html">new IR attribute,  incoming-stack-align</a>. This is needed for Wine which may require functions to have an ABI stack  alignment different to the host's alignment.</p></li></ul><h3>LLVM commits</h3><ul><li><p>A new Error support class has been added to support structured error  handling. See the associated updates to the LLVM programmer's manual for more  info. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL263609">r263609</a>.</p></li><li><p>New documentation was committed for advanced CMake build configurations. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL263834">r263834</a>.</p></li><li><p>Support was added for MIPS32R6 compact branches. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL263444">r263444</a>.</p></li><li><p>The MemCpyOptimizer will now attempt to reorder instructions in order to  create an optimisable sequence. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL263503">r263503</a>.</p></li><li><p>llvm-readobj learnt to print sections and relocations in the GNU style. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL263561">r263561</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Clang commits</h3><ul><li><p>Attributes have been added for the <code>preserve_mostcc</code> and <code>preserve_allcc</code>  calling conventions. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL263647">r263647</a>.</p></li><li><p>clang-format will handle some cases of automatic semicolon insertion in  JavaScript. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL263470">r263470</a>.</p></li><li><p>Clang learned to convert some Objective-C message sends to runtime calls. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL263607">r263607</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Other project commits</h3><ul><li><p>AddressSanitizer is now supported on mips/mips64 Android. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL263261">r263261</a>.</p></li><li><p>The documentation on the LLD linker has added a few numbers to give an idea  of the sort of inputs it needs to handle. e.g. Chrome with debug info contains  roughly 13M relocations, 6.3M symbols, 1.8M sections and 17k files. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL263466">r263466</a>.</p></li></ul>
