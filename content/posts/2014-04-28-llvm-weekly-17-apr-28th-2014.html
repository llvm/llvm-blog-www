<p>Welcome to the 17th issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter (published every  Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related projects. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by <a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex Bradbury</a>. Subscribe to future issues at <a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org</a> and pass it on to anyone  else you think may be interested. Please send any tips or feedback to  <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury</a> on Twitter.</p><p>Last week I wondered why the GCC logo is a <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GNU_Compiler_Collection_logo.svg">GNU leaping out of an egg</a>. Thank you to everyone who wrote in to let me know it is a reference to EGCS. GCC was of course famously forked as EGCS which was later merged back in. Apparently this was pronounced by some as "eggs". Mystery solved.</p> <p>The canonical home for this issue <a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/17">can be found here at llvmweekly.org</a>. </p>  <a name='more'></a> <h3>News and articles from around the web</h3><p>GCC 4.9.0 was <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2014-04/msg00195.html">released last  Tuesday</a>. See  <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.9/changes.html">here</a> for more detailed notes on  changes in this release.</p><p>Honza Hubička wrote a blog post on the <a href="http://hubicka.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/linktime-optimization-in-gcc-1-brief.html">history of linktime optimisation in  GCC</a>,  which was followed by a post containing a <a href="http://hubicka.blogspot.ca/2014/04/linktime-optimization-in-gcc-2-firefox.html">benchmark comparison of LTO in GCC  vs  LLVM</a>.</p><p>On Twitter, @lambdamix drew my attention to <a href="http://www.cs.umb.edu/~offner/files/flow_graph.pdf">Notes on Graph Algorithms Used in Optimizing Compilers</a>  (PDF). I imagine it will be of interest to many LLVM Weekly readers.</p><h3>On the mailing lists</h3><ul><li><p>Michael Zolotukhin <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72466">proposes extending LLVM IR with new intrinsics for safe  division</a>. These join the existing intrinsics for addition with overflow. Filip Pizlo  follows up with a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72510">description of how it would be used for various potential  language  frontends</a>. Michael has also posted a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72533">detailed justification in answer to concerns  raised</a>.</p></li><li><p>James Molloy <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.cvs/185388/">shares an updated on the AArch64 to ARM64  merge</a>,  including time estimates for remaining tasks. The initial merge should be  complete before LLVM 3.5. Additionally, Ana Pazos has gained permission to  share <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72454/">relative SPEC2000 figures for ARM64 vs  AArch64</a>.</p></li><li><p>Sylvestre Ledru <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/36229">proposes removing outdated marketing material from the  Clang  website</a>. In  particular, the performance comparisons are with GCC 4.0 or 4.2 which is of  course rather outdated, particularly given how GCC has improved since then.</p></li><li><p>Kostya Serebryany reports that <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/36234">AddressSanitizer and LeakSanitizer are  finding many many leaks within  Clang</a>. The  bug tracking this is <a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19521">#19521</a>.</p></li><li><p>Tom Stellard has <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72524">kicked off the second testing phase for LLVM and Clang  3.4.1</a>. This  is expected to be the last release candidate, so 3.4.1 shouldn't be far away.</p></li></ul><h3>LLVM commits</h3><ul><li><p>The 'musttail' marker which was <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71775">proposed several weeks  ago</a> has been  added. Unlike the 'tail' marker, musttail guarantees that tail call  optimization will occur. Check the documentation added in the commit for a  more detailed explanation. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207143">r207143</a>.</p></li><li><p>The rewrite of BlockFrequencyInfo finally landed. A description of the  advantages of the new algorithm is in the original commit message,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206548">r206548</a>. After a series of bounces, it  landed in <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206766">r206766</a>.</p></li><li><p>LLVM can now generate PE/COFF object files targeting 'Windows on ARM'. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207345">r207345</a>.</p></li><li><p>A CallGraph strongly connected components pass manager has been added making  use of the new LazyCallGraph analysis framework. This is part of the new pass  manager work Chandler Carruth has been working on and is of course a work in  progress. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206745">r206745</a>.</p></li><li><p>The scheduler model for the Intel Silvermont microarchitecture has been  replaced. The commit message claims substantial improvements on integer tests. I'm assuming RAL in this context refers to RegAllocLocal? <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206957">r206957</a>.</p></li><li><p>ARM64 has of course seen a large number of changes. Among those, support for  feature predicates for NEON/FP/CYPTO instructions. This allows the compiler to  generate code without using those instructions. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206949">r206949</a>. Additionally, there is now a big  endian version of the ARM64 target machine. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206965">r206965</a>.</p></li><li><p>getFileOffset has been dropped from LLVM's C API. Justification is in the  commit message. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206750">r206750</a>.</p></li><li><p>The LoopVectorize pass now keeps statistics on the number of analyzed loops  and the number of vectorized loops. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206956">r206956</a>.</p></li><li><p>The x86 backend gained new intrinsics for Read Time Stamp Counter. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207127">r207127</a>.</p></li><li><p>Initial work on mutation support for the lazy call graph has landed. As with  most of Chandler's commits, there's much more information in the commit  message. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206968">r206968</a>.</p></li><li><p>MCTargetOptions has been introduced, which for now only contains a single  flag. SanitizeAddress enabled AddressSanitizer instrumentation of inline  assembly. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206971">r206971</a>.</p></li><li><p>llvm-cov now supports gcov's <code>--long-file-names</code> option. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207035">r207035</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Clang commits</h3><ul><li><p>Documentation for sample profiling was added. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206994">r206994</a>.</p></li><li><p>Support for parsing the linear clause for the 'omp simd' directive was  added. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206891">r206891</a>.</p></li><li><p>Clang gained support for the <code>-fmodules-search-all</code> option, which searches  for symbols in non-imported modules (i.e. those referenced in module maps but  not imported). <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206977">r206977</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Other project commits</h3><ul>  <li><p>AddressSanitizer gained an experimental detector for "one definition rule"  violations (where two globals with the same name are defined in different  modules). <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207210">r207210</a>.</p></li></ul>
