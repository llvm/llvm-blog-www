title: LLDB 3.3 and beyond
---

<div class="MsoNormal">The LLVM project debugger (LLDB) has seen a recent upswing of activity around the LLVM 3.3 release.&nbsp; While the debugger has long been the default tool with Xcode, its potential beyond Darwin has had room to grow.&nbsp; Especially within the last year, the development community has grown beyond its roots with OS/X and iOS to include substantial contributions for Linux, Windows, and FreeBSD. In addition, experimental packages are available for a growing number of distributions including Debian, Ubuntu and Arch.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /><a name='more'></a><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Much of the potential draws from the architecture of LLDB.&nbsp; The debugger is well suited to debugging the latest C++ code because of its reuse of LLVM and Clang.&nbsp; This includes the LLVM dynamic execution engine (MCJIT) for expression evaluation, the LLVM disassembler and the use of the Clang AST parser.&nbsp; The reuse of LLVM project components has kept LLDB lightweight and has focused developer efforts on the core tasks of being a good debugger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Overall, this modern debugger has been well designed from the ground up for multi-threaded debugging, lazy symbolication, versatile unwind, and a hierarchical command set including both C++ and Python interfaces.&nbsp; The availability of these core interfaces allows LLDB to fulfill its name as a low-level debugger.&nbsp; Developers can use the LLDB libraries for format-neutral access to information in object files such as debug information, symbols, types, functions, line tables and more.&nbsp; &nbsp;This information is useful to develop debuggers, symbolication tools, and analysis tools.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Python is currently embedded inside of LLDB and available through an interactive interpreter.&nbsp; The available command set allows arbitrary Python code to be run on breakpoints, watch-points, data summaries and formatters, and the like. The LLDB shared library can also be accessed in Python scripts on the command line.&nbsp; Overall, the ability to customize LLDB behavior using arbitrary Python code, write extensions using Python, and to evaluate arbitrary C++ expressions contribute to the versatility of this project.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Recent LLDB packages have closed some of the feature gap with LLDB on Linux relative to Darwin.&nbsp; This includes support for multi-threaded debugging, watch-points and vector register sets.&nbsp; In addition there have been many improvements to process control, expression evaluation, the build system and support of i386 targets.&nbsp; Upcoming features include JIT debugging, core file support and support of new processor features.&nbsp; Much of this work impacts any POSIX distribution including FreeBSD.&nbsp; Currently, x86-64 Linux builds and targets are tested on trunk (using GCC and Clang) with every commit to LLVM, Clang and LLDB.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">The activity on Linux for x86-64 is just part of the picture.&nbsp; A Windows branch has been developed with the first port of remote debugging to a non-Darwin platform.&nbsp; Work is just underway to assess LLDB on FreeBSD, with ICC and for i386 targets.&nbsp; In fact, the number of active contributors to LLDB has more than doubled in the last year alone.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">At this point in the growth of LLDB, feedback is very welcome, as we grow the test coverage and use the tool to debug increasingly more complex applications.&nbsp; Increasingly, LLDB is a responsive debugger that can handle some of the harder cases of multi-threaded C++ debugging effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">For more information about LLDB architecture, features, source code, packages, feature status or build information, visit <a href="http://lldb.llvm.org/">lldb.llvm.org</a>. &nbsp;If you have questions or comments about this release, please contact the&nbsp;<a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/lldb-dev" target="_blank">lldb-dev</a>&nbsp;mailing list!</div><br /><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div>
