<p>Welcome to the forty-seventh issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter  (published every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related  projects. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by <a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex  Bradbury</a>. Subscribe to future issues at  <a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org</a> and pass it on to anyone else you think may be  interested. Please send any tips or feedback to <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury</a> on Twitter.</p>  <p>The canonical home for this issue <a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/47">can be found here at llvmweekly.org</a>. </p>  <a name='more'></a> <h3>News and articles from around the web</h3><p>Version 3.0 of the Capstone disassembly framework <a href="http://capstone-engine.org/Version-3.0.html">has been  released</a>. Python bindings have  been updated to support Python 3, and this release also adds support for  Sparc, SystemZ and XCore. It also has performance improvements.</p><p>Herb Sutter has penned a <a href="https://isocpp.org/blog/2014/11/trip-report-fall">trip  report</a> of the recent ISO  C++ meeting.</p><p>Emscripten has <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/emscripten-discuss/y1_efkXYIQM">updated to use LLVM 3.4 from the PNaCl team</a>. There's more work to be done to rebase on top of 3.5.</p><p>Woboq has written a blog post <a href="http://woboq.com/blog/cpp14-in-qt.html">detailing C++14 features of interest to Qt  programmers</a>, though I suspect the  article has a wider potential audience than that. Recent Clang of course has  <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#cxx14">good support</a> for the new C++14  features.</p><p>There is going to be an LLVM Devroom at FOSDEM 2015, and the <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.lldb.devel/5757">submission  deadline for presentations/talks/tutorials is on Dec  1st</a>.</p><p>Apple's LLVM Source Tools and Program Analysis teams are <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/39769">looking for interns  for Summer  2015</a>.</p><h3>On the mailing lists</h3><ul><li><p>If you're wondering how the process of adding OpenMP support to Clang is  going, the  <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/39749">answer</a> is  that it's still ongoing and there's hope it will be done by the 3.6 release,  depending on the speed of code reviews.</p></li><li><p>Siva Chandra kicked off a discussion on the mailing list about <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.lldb.devel/5765">how to  better manage breakages caused by LLVM or Clang API  changes</a>. Siva  suggests LLDB should be developed against a known-good version of LLVM/Clang  that gets periodically bumped. Vince Harron says that he is <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.lldb.devel/5780">looking to add a  continuous build on curated versions of  Clang/LLVM</a> in  addition to a continuous build on top of tree for everything. This should help  improve the signal to noise ratio and make it easier for LLDB developers to  tell when a breaking change is due to their addition or a change elsewhere. Reid Kleckner <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.lldb.devel/5783">suggests lldb should be treated part of the same project as  Clang/LLDB</a> and  more pressure should be put on developers to fix breakages, presumably in the  same way that API changes in LLVM almost always come with an associated patch  to fix Clang.</p></li><li><p>Peter Collingbourne has proposed <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78981">adding the llgo frontend to the LLVM  project</a>. Chris Lattner is <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78982">in favour of  this</a>, but  would like to see the GPLv3+runtime exception dependencies rewritten before  being checked in. Some people in the thread expressed concern that the  existing base of LLVM/Clang reviewers know C++ and may not be able to review  patches in Go, though it looks like a non-zero of existing LLVM reviewers are  appropriately multilingual.</p></li><li><p>Brett Simmers is working on HHVM and <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78971">is interested if there are ways to  control where a BasicBlock ends up in  memory</a>, with  the motivation to make best of the instruction cache by keeping frequently  executed pieces of code closer together. There's general agreement this would  be a great feature to have, but it doesn't sound like this is easily supported  in LLVM right now.</p></li></ul><h3>LLVM commits</h3><ul><li><p>A small doc fix has the honour of being <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL222222">commit  222222</a>.</p></li><li><p>A nice little optimisation has been committed which replaces a switch table  with a mul and add if there is a linear mapping between index and output. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL222121">r222121</a>.</p></li><li><p>The SeparateConstOffsetFromGEP, EarlyCSE, and LICM passes have been enabled  on AArch64.
