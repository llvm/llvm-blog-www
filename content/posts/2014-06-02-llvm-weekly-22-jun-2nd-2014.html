<p>Welcome to the twenty-second issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter  (published every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related  projects.LLVM Weekly is brought to you by <a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex Bradbury</a>. Subscribe to future issues at <a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org</a> and pass it on to anyone  else you think may be interested. Please send any tips or feedback to  <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury</a> on Twitter.</p><p>Last week I expressed worry about GMANE not updating. I'm happy to report that  it's back to normal now. Some of my readers might be interested in my <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/raspberry-pi-projects-at-the-maker-faire-bay-area/">account  of the neat Raspberry Pi-based projects I saw at Maker Faire Bay  Area</a>.</p><p>The canonical home for this issue <a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/22">can be found here at llvmweekly.org</a>. </p>  <a name='more'></a><h3>News and articles from around the web</h3><p>David Given has  <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73349">shared</a> his  partially complete backend for the VideoCore IV VPU as used in the BCM2835 in  the Raspberry Pi. It would also be interesting to see a QPU LLVM backend now  it has been <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/a-birthday-present-from-broadcom/">publicly  documented</a>.</p><p>Documentation on how TableGen's DAGISel backend works <a href="https://github.com/draperlaboratory/fracture/wiki/How-TableGen%27s-DAGISel-Backend-Works">has been  updated</a>.</p><p>The <a href="http://llvm-hpc-workshop.github.io/">LLVM Compiler Infrastructure in HPC  Workshop</a> has been announced. This is a  workshop to be held in conjunction with SC14. The deadline for the call for  papers is September 1st.</p><p><a href="http://people.collabora.com/~pwith/gnome-clang/">Tartan</a> is a Clang analysis  plugin for GLib and GNOME. To quote its homepage "The plugin works by loading  gobject-introspection metadata for all functions it encounters (both functions  exported by the code being compiled, if it is a library; and functions called  by it). This metadata is then used to add compiler attributes to the code,  such as non-NULL attributes, which the compiler can then use for static  analysis and emitting extra compiler warnings."</p><h3>On the mailing lists</h3><ul><li><p>Jack Howarth has posted to ask <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/36961">what can be done to merge the clang-omp  merge along more  quickly</a>. Andrey Bokhanko followed up with some <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/36974">clarifications and  elaborations</a>. Hal Finkel has also <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/36981">more clearly described the OpenMP language support vs the  OpenMP runtime  library</a>.</p></li><li><p>Simon Cook posed an interesting question about <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73365">a backend with 32-bit  registers for load/store but otherwise mostly 16  bit</a>. Sadly  there are no answers yet.</p></li><li><p>Qiong Cai has a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73325">few questions on LLVM  JIT</a>. Philip  Reames <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73339">answers  concisely</a>.</p></li><li><p>Tim Northover <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73355">proposes adding load linked and store conditional atomic  instructions to LLVM  IR</a>. David  Chisnall has a thorough <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73413">answer to the  proposal</a> that  suggests weak cmpxchg would be an easier and overall better addition.</p></li></ul><h3>LLVM commits</h3><ul><li><p>A LoadCombine pass was added, though is disabled by default for now. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL209791">r209791</a>.</p></li><li><p>AAPCS-VFP has been taught to deal with Cortex-M4 (which only has single  precision floating point). <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL209650">r209650</a>.</p></li><li><p>InstructionCombining gained support for combining GEPs across PHI nodes. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL209843">r209843</a>.</p></li><li><p>Vectorization of intrinsics such as powi, cttz and ctlz is now allowed. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL209873">r209873</a>.</p></li><li><p>MIPS64 long branch has been optimised to be 3 instructions smaller. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL209678">r209678</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Clang commits</h3><ul><li><p>OpenMP implementation continues. Parsing and Sema have been implemented for  OMPAlignedClause. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL209816">r209816</a>.</p></li><li><p>The <code>-Rpass-missed</code> and <code>-Rpass-analysis</code> flags have been added. pass-missed  is used by optimizers to inform the user when they tried to apply an  optimisation but couldn't, while pass-analysis is used to report analysis  results back to the user. A followup commit documents the family of flags. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL209839">r209839</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL209841">r209841</a>.</p></li><li><p>The clang optimize pragma has now been documented. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL209738">r209738</a>.</p></li><li><p>There has been some API refactoring. The release and take methods were  removed from ActionResult and Owned removed from Sema. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL209800">r209800</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL209812">r209812</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Other project commits</h3><ul><li>ThreadSanitizer has seen a refactoring of storage of meta information for  heap blocks and sync objects. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL209810">r209810</a>.</li></ul>
