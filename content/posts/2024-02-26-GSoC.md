The LLVM organization was accepted to participate in Google Summer of Code in 2024. Soon, prospective participants will begin submitting their project proposals, and mentors will review them to select those who will spend a significant amount of time this year contributing to various parts of LLVM.

But first, let's look back and see what we had in 2023. The Google Summer of Code 2023 was very successful for the LLVM project. Overall, we received 54 proposals for 24 open projects. Out of this set of proposals, 20 projects were successfully completed and covered many different aspects of LLVM and its subprojects.

## GSoC 2024
With a successful end to 2023, the LLVM Project is excited to participate in GSOC 2024. If you are interested in participating, here are some guidelines:

### 1. Project ideas
Please take a look on list of projects at [Open Projects](https://llvm.org/OpenProjects.html#gsoc24) page. Projects also have topics below on [LLVM Discourse](https://discourse.llvm.org/tag/gsoc2024) having #gsoc24 tag, so you can ask mentors about details of the project, skills required, etc.

### 2. Way to submitting a proposal
We encourage you to discuss your proposal before submitting to GSoC system. Having your proposal discussed ensures that your proposal will be well aligned with the project. Please do not hijack other threads (e.g. with mentor Q&A) and create a separate new thread to discuss your proposal. The ideal proposal will contain:
 * A descriptive title
 * Information about you, including contact information. Please do not forget to include:
   - Your prior compiler and compiler-related experience, if any (e.g. studies at the University, prior contributions)
   - Whether you have any prior contributions to LLVM. If yes, please provide links to these contributions.
   - Your past open source participation and contributions, if any
   - Your knowledge of programming languages (e.g. C, C++, Python, Rust, etc.) and your estimate of your level of experience
 * Information about your proposed project. This should be fairly detailed and include a timeline.
 * Information about other commitments that might affect your ability to work during the GSoC period (exams, classes, holidays, other jobs, weddings, etc.). Also, if the project allows both medium- and large-size participation, indicate the intended size of the project and the timeframe of your participation.
