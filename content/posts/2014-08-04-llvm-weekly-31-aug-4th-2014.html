<p>Welcome to the thirty-first issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter  (published every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related  projects. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by <a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex  Bradbury</a>. Subscribe to future issues at  <a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org</a> and pass it on to anyone else you think may be  interested. Please send any tips or feedback to  <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury</a> on Twitter.</p> <p>The canonical home for this issue <a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/31">can be found here at llvmweekly.org</a>. </p>  <a name='more'></a> <h3>News and articles from around the web</h3><p>Renato Golin has posted a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75207">summary of feedback from his talk on LLVM and GCC  collaboration at the GNU Tools  Cauldron</a>. This both summarises the main areas he's looking for collaboration, and the  feedback that people gave at the event or afterwards.</p><p>This blog post describes <a href="http://fuzion24.github.io/android/obfuscation/ndk/llvm/o-llvm/2014/07/27/android-obfuscation-o-llvm-ndk/">how to use Obfuscator-LLVM to to obfuscate Android  NDK  binaries</a>.</p><h3>On the mailing lists</h3><ul><li><p>Johannes Kapfhammer, a Google Summer of Code student has <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/38105">posted an RFC on  adding a fuzzy parser for highlighting  C++</a>. The  Clang parser can't be used for this as it may be highlighting incomplete  snippets where not all types or functions are included. It was pointed out in  responses that this is similar to clang-format's parser, but apparently this  parser is not easily reusable and very tied to the clang-format  implementation.</p></li><li><p>In response to a query about whether there is interest in a performance  tracking BOF at the LLVM Dev meeting, Renato Golin has posted a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75410">summary of  related issues discussed at the last meeting and progress made on  them</a>.</p></li><li><p>John Kåre Alsaker posted a question about <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75230">adding a stack probe function  attribute</a>. This would be used for languages like Rust that attempt to detect stack  overflow with the use of a guard page. Philip Reames responded with <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75399">a number  of thoughts on this  feature</a>.</p></li><li><p>Daniel Stewart has <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75350">implemented ELF/AArch64 support for  lld</a> and is  looking for how to upstream it. People are happy for a single patch to be  posted for review.</p></li><li><p>In response to a question about documentation for adding builders to the  LLVM buildbot service, Dan Liew has posted a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75355">summary of how he has done  it</a>. He's  looking for feedback on whether this is the best way to do things.</p></li><li><p>John Kåre Alsaker has asked for feedback on <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75231">enhancing BasicAliasAnalysis  for Rust</a>. Rust's restrictions on aliasing are not currenly fully taken advantage of. Both <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75260">Hal  Finkel</a> and  <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75286">Cameron  Zwarich</a>  respond with thoughts on how to proceed.</p></li><li><p>Tom Stellard <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75214">proposes renaming the R600 target to  AMDGPU</a>. The  motivation is that the backend has the name since the R600 was the first AMD  GPU targeted, but it has added support for all AMD GPUs since then. There  seems to be agreement this would be a sensible renaming.</p></li></ul><h3>LLVM commits</h3><ul><li><p>FastISel for AArch64 saw a number of improvements, including support for  shift-immediate, arithmetic with overflow intrinsics. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214345">r214345</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214348">r214348</a>, and more.</p></li><li><p>The SLPVectorizer has seen a largeish commit that implements an "improved  scheduling algorithm". Sadly the commit message offers no further details. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214494">r214494</a>.</p></li><li><p>TargetInstrInfo gained <code>isAsCheapAsMove</code> which takes a MachineInstruction  and returns true if that instruction is as cheap as a move instruction. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214158">r214158</a>.</p></li><li><p>LLVM libraries can now be exported as importable CMake targets, making it  easier for those building LLVM-based projects. This is now documented. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214077">r214077</a>.</p></li><li><p>Release notes for PowerPC changes during 3.5 development have been  committed. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214403">r214403</a>.</p></li><li><p>Initial work towards supporting debug locations for fragmented variables  (e.g. by-value struct arguments passed in registers) has been committed. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214576">r214576</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Clang commits</h3><ul><li><p>Work on support for the MSVC ABI continues. Clang will now consider required  alignment constraints on fields. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214274">r214274</a>.</p></li><li><p>AddressSanitizer now passes source-level information from Clang to ASan  using metadata rather than by creating global variables. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214604">r214604</a>.</p></li><li><p>The PowerPC backend now support selection of the ELFv1/ELFv2 ABI via the  <code>-mabi=</code> option. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214074">r214074</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Other project commits</h3><ul><li><p>lld gained support for interworking between thumb and ARM code with Mach-O  binaries. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214140">r214140</a>.</p></li><li><p>A massive ABI testsuite (contributed by Sony) has been committed to the  test-suite repo. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214126">r214126</a>.</p></li></ul>
