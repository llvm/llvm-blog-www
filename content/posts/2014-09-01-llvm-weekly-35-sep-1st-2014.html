<p>Welcome to the thirty-fifth issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter  (published every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related  projects.LLVM Weekly is brought to you by <a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex  Bradbury</a>. Subscribe to future issues at  <a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org</a> and pass it on to anyone else you think may be  interested. Please send any tips or feedback to  <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#97;&#115;&#98;&#64;&#97;&#115;&#98;&#114;&#97;&#100;&#98;&#117;&#114;&#121;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury</a> on Twitter.</p> <p>As I mentioned in a previous issue, I am involved in the  <a href="http://lowrisc.org">lowRISC</a> projects to produce a fully open-source SoC. Just a  quick reminder that <a href="http://www.jobs.cam.ac.uk/job/4665/">we are hiring</a>, and  you have just over a week to get your application in.</p>  <p>The canonical home for this issue <a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/35">can be found here at llvmweekly.org</a>. </p>  <a name='more'></a> <h3>News and articles from around the web</h3><p>LLVM/Clang 3.5 is inching ever closer to release. The fourth and hopefully  final release candidate is <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76370">available for  testing</a>.</p><p>Quarks Lab have published a <a href="http://blog.quarkslab.com/scaf-source-code-analysis-framework-based-on-clang-pre-alpha-preview.html">preview of  SCAF</a>,  a Source Code Analysis Framework built on Clang. It promises a release soon.</p><p>The <a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org/">VMKit project website</a> has this week been  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216831">updated</a> to mark the project as retired. VMKit was a project to implement virtual machines such as a JVM on top of  LLVM. People interested in restarting the project are encouraged to get in  touch with Gaël Thomas.</p><p>AMD and Microsoft have <a href="http://sdtimes.com/amd-announces-heterogeneous-c-amp-language-developers/">released a C++ AMP compiler targeting version 1.2 of  the specification</a>. The C++ AMP (Accelerated Massive Parallelism) compiler is of course based on  LLVM and Clang, and can be <a href="https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/cppamp-driver-ng/wiki/Home">found  here</a>.</p><h3>On the mailing lists</h3><ul><li><p>Manuel Klimek has provided a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/38657">quick run-down of the state of his work on  Clang C++ refactoring  tools</a>. He  reports there are a number of standalone, single-use refacotring tools but  more work needs to be done on generalising and integrating them. The plan is  to push more of these tools to tools-extra (where clang-rename lives), make  them integratable as a library, integrate them into libclang and then  integrate them into projects like <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd">ycmd</a>.</p></li><li><p>Robin Morisset has been working on optimisations for lowering of atomics and  has <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76400">asked for input on a fence elimination  algorithm</a>  he's been thinking about. He has outlined two possible implementation routes  he would like feedback on.</p></li><li><p>A discussion about <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76278">improving  llvm-objdump</a>,  kicked offed by Steve King, makes an interesting read. I'm looking forward to  a future with a more featureful llvm-objdump that prints symbols of branch  targets by default.</p></li><li><p>David Blaikie has started a discussion about <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76341">supporting -gmlt in  LLVM/Clang</a>. Vital to having any chance of understanding this thread is to know that gmlt  refers to debug info containing 'minimal line tables', a feature that <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2011-04/msg02075.html">was  added to GCC a while  back</a>.</p></li><li><p>I linked last week to the mailing list thread on removing static  initializers for command line options and regrettably was unable to summarise  the extensive discussion. The bad news is discussion has continued at a rapid  pace, but thankfully Chandler Carruth has rather helpfully <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76279">sumarised the main  outcomes of the discussion</a>. It's also worth reading <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76382">this  thread</a> for an  idea of what the new infrastructure might look like.</p></li></ul><h3>LLVM commits</h3><ul><li><p>The AArch64 backend learned about v4f16 and v8f16 operations,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216555">r216555</a>.</p></li><li><p>The LLVM CMake build system now includes support for building with  UndefinedBehaviourSanitizer. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216701">r216701</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Clang commits</h3><ul><li><p>The <code>-fdevirtualize</code> and <code>-fdevirtualize-speculatively</code> flags are now  recognised (and ignored) for compatibility with GCC. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216477">r216477</a>.</p></li><li><p>Some Google Summer of Code work has started to land. In particular, the  Clang static analyzer gained initial infrastructure to support for  synthesizing function implementations from external model files. See the  commit message for full details on the intent of this feature. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216550">r216550</a>.</p></li><li><p>Support was added for capturing variable length arrays in C++11 lambda  expressions. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216649">r216649</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Other project commits</h3><ul><li><p>LLDB gained documentation on its internal register numbering scheme. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216372">r216372</a>.</p></li><li><p>LLDB is making progress towards AArch64 support. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216737">r216736</a>.</p></li></ul>
