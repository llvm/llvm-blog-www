<p>Welcome to the seventy-first issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter  (published every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related  projects. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by <a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex  Bradbury</a>.

Well done to everyone involved.</p><p>Most slides from the presentations at <a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2015-04/">EuroLLVM  2015</a> are now online. Video is <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/85455">coming  soon</a>.</p><p>Version 3.5.1 of Clang UPC, the Unified Parallel C compiler has <a href="http://clangupc.github.io/2015/04/15/clang-upc-3-5-1-0-announcment/">been  released</a>. The main change seems to be the move to Clang/LLVM 3.5.</p><p>The Pony Language, which features an LLVM backend has recently <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/85486">been  released</a>. It  received quite a lot of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9482483">discussion on Hacker  News</a>.</p><p>Many readers might be interested in this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/35g7f6/">update from the last C++  standardization committee  meeting</a>.</p><p>IBM have posted some bounties for <a href="https://www.bountysource.com/issues/11873163-enable-thread-sanitizer-for-ppc64">TSAN  support</a>  and <a href="https://www.bountysource.com/issues/11872976-enable-memory-sanitizer-for-ppc64">MSAN  support</a>  for PPC64.</p><h3>On the mailing lists</h3><ul><li><p>Renato Golin has been asking about interest in <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/85385">improving the LLVM online  code coverage  report</a>. Joshua Cranmer shared the work he did on <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/85424">code coverage for Thunderbird and  Firefox</a>.</p></li><li><p>John Criswell has followed up on an older thread about the LLVM DSA work  giving <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/85380">some useful  insight</a>, and  <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/85461">some more</a>.</p></li><li><p>Hubert Tong is interested in working on <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/42564">implementing the C++ Concepts  Technical Specification in  Clang</a>, and  would like anyone who's interested in collaborating or has already made a  start to get in touch.</p></li><li><p>Quentin Colombet has posted a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/85322">heads-up about his shrink-wrap pass  work</a>,  including details on how to enable support in your backend (in-tree or  out-of-tree).</p></li><li><p>Last week's discussion about improving LLD has rumbled on. Chris Lattner  <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/85298">suggested working on two  linkers</a>, one  to serve the needs of those who primarily want a usable BSD-licensed system  linker and another a 'next generation' linker trying to meet the original aims  of LLD, developed without the same constraints on compatibility. Alex  Rosenberg gave a good <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/85247">summary of the original aims of  LLD</a> and how  recent changes have moved it further from those aims. It looks like <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/85483">a path  forwards is being  identified</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>LLVM commits</h3><ul><li><p>A new 'shrink-wrap' pass has been added. It attempts to insert the prologue  and epilogue of a function somewhere other than the entry/exit blocks. See the  commit message for a motivating example. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL236507">r236507</a>.</p></li><li><p>Support for the z13 processor and its vector capabilities have been added to  the SystemZ backend. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL236520">r236520</a>,  <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL236521">r236521</a>.</p></li><li><p>Documentation has been written for the new masked gather and scatter  intrinsics. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL236721">r236721</a>.</p></li><li><p>The statepoint intrinsic has been extended to allow statepoints to be marked  as tranditions from GC-aware code to nonGC-aware code. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL236888">r236888</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Clang commits</h3><ul><li><p>Clang support for the z13 processor was added. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL236531">r236531</a>.</p></li><li><p>Thread-safe initialization using the MSVC 2015 ABI has been implemented. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL236697">r236697</a>.</p></li><li><p>User-friendly <code>-fsanitize-coverage=</code> flags are now available. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL236790">r236790</a>.</p></li></ul><h3>Other project commits</h3><ul><li>libiomp's CMake has been integrated into the LLVM CMake build system, so you  can now checkout libiomp and have it built alongside llvm, clang and so on. <a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL236534">r236534</a>.</li></ul>
