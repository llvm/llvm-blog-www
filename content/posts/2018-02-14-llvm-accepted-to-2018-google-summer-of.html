We are excited to announce the LLVM project has been accepted to&nbsp;<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6471192286855168/">2018 Google Summer of Code</a>!<br /><br /><b>What is Google Summer of Code?</b><br /><b><br /></b>Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program focused on introducing students to open source software development. Students work on a 3 month programming project with an open source organization during their break from university. There are several benefits to this program for both the students and LLVM:<br /><br /><ul><li>Inspire students to get involved with open source, compilers and LLVM</li><li>Give students exposure to real-world software development while getting paid a stipend</li><li>Allow students to do paid work related to their academic pursuits versus getting an unrelated summer job</li><li>Bring new developers into the LLVM project</li><li>Some LLVM bugs get fixed or new features get added</li></ul><br /><b>Students - Apply now!&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>Ok, so you can't apply right now as the official application to GSoC does not open until March 12, 2018, but you must begin discussing your project on the <a href="http://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo">LLVM mailing lists</a> well before that date. There are many <a href="http://llvm.org/OpenProjects.html#gsoc18">open projects listed on our webpage</a>. Once you have selected a project, you will discuss it on the appropriate mailing list.<br /><br />If you have an idea for a project that is not listed, you can always propose it on the list as well and seek out a mentor.<br /><br /><b>Key Dates to Remember</b><br /><b><br /></b>We have listed a few key dates here, but always consult the<a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline">&nbsp;official GSoC timeline</a>&nbsp;to confirm.<br /><br /><ul><li>March 12 (16:00 UTC) - Applications open</li><li>March 27 (16:00 UTC) - Deadline to file your application</li><li>April 23 (16:00 UTC) - Accepted student proposals are announced</li><li>May 14 - Coding begins</li></ul><br /><b><br /></b><b>LLVM Developers - Consider&nbsp;being mentor!</b><br /><b><br /></b>This program is not a success without our mentors. Thank you to all that have all who have already volunteered! If you have never mentored a GSoC project but are curious, it is not too late to volunteer! You can either select an <a href="http://llvm.org/OpenProjects.html#gsoc18">open project</a> without a mentor or propose your own. Make sure to get it listed on the webpage so that students can see it as an option.<br /><br />If mentoring just isn't an option for you at this time, consider helping the project out my spreading the word about GSoC.<br /><br /><b>Questions?</b><br /><b><br /></b>If you have questions about the program for the organizers, please email <a href="mailto:gsoc@lists.llvm.org">gsoc@lists.llvm.org</a>. Project specific questions should be sent to the appropriate <a href="http://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo">developer mailing list</a> instead.<br /><br />
