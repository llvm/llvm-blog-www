Welcome to the LLVM Blog!

To create a new post on this blog start by cloning the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-blog-www.git
```

Content on the blog is located in the `content/posts` directory. There is a
template file located in `content/template.md` that can be used as a starting
point. It contains the meta data that the author of each blog needs to fill out.
The naming convention used for the posts is: `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-blog.md`. 

Once the blog contents have been filled in, the file should be placed under the
`content/post` directory. You can then use [hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/)
to build the blogs and start a webserver on your local machine to view the content.

You can find the version of Hugo to use in the `main.yaml` file in the
`.github/workflows` directory.

```sh
hugo server -D
```

This should create output similar to:

```

Note the second last line that specifies the Web Server that is now running. You
can direct your browser to this page to view the contents. Note that this will
build *all* of the blogs, including yours, so you can see how it will appear on
the official LLVM website.


Once you are happy with the content of your blog post, and checked that it
renders properly the final step is to issue a pull request to merge it into the
main branch of the llvm-blog-www repository.
