Two interns have been selected: Sushma Unnibhavi &amp;amp; Pooja Yadav.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Outreachy provides paid, remote internships with the goal of increasing diversity in open source. Outreachy interns work with mentors from open source communites on projects in programming, user experience, documentation, illustration, graphical design, data science, project marketing, user advocacy, or community event planning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sushma will be working with her mentor Kit Barton on her project to &lt;em>Create Documentation and Tutorials for the LLVM Global Instruction Selection Framework&lt;/em>. Pooja will be working with her mentor Anshil Gandhi on her project to &lt;em>Implement GlobalISel for the M68k backend in LLVM&lt;/em>. T&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you to the &lt;a href="https://foundation.llvm.org/docs/sponsors/">sponsors&lt;/a> of the &lt;a href="https://foundation.llvm.org">LLVM Foundation&lt;/a> as their support has made these internships possible. In addition, we would like to give a huge thank you to Kit and Anshil for mentoring!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We asked Sushma and Pooja a few questions about themselves and the project they are working on. Here are their answers:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Sushma Unnibhavi&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Can you tell us about yourself and your background?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am Sushma, a final year Information Science Engineering undergrad
from India. My hobbies include drawing, dancing and reading. I love
writing code. I have been obsessed with the idea of using software to
solve practical problems. I love to dig into problems and solve them
with modern technology. I am constantly learning because I never
settle. I focus on making high-quality decisions and love meeting new
people and hearing new perspectives. My specialities include learning
new skills and programming languages and problem-solving.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>How did you hear about Outreachy and why did you apply?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I first came to know about Outreachy from my brother and searched for
it right away. I found out that Outreachy seeks interns who are
talented and have a zeal to learn while most of the other internships
sought for the experience. I have always wanted to contribute to open
source but never got proper guidance. Then I read the experiences of
previous Outreachy interns which really motivated me. Many of them
didn’t have any prior experience and they were supported so much from
the mentors that made them reach greater heights. This made me
think…..If they can, why can’t I? Hence I decided to apply to
Outreachy. The way I have seen myself grow by contributing to LLVM in
the one month time span of the contribution period is really
surprising.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Which project will you be working on?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will be implementing GloballSel for M68k. I will be adding minimal
support necessary to select a function that returns sum of two i32
values. This includes some very naive and hardcoded argument/return
lowering as well as handling of copy and add instructions throughout
globalisel pipeline. I will also be implementing lowering for
operations including add, sub, mul, div, comp, phi, load and store.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>What are you most looking forward to during your internship?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I am looking forward to in this internship is a great
learning experience. When I first started contributing to LLVM, I
thought I wouldn’t stand a chance because I had never worked on a
project with such a huge codebase and that too working on compilers
was a nightmare for me. Through this internship I want to let go of
this fear and become more confident. I want to prove to myself that
with hard work and consistency nothing is impossible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Pooja Yadav&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Can you tell us about yourself and your background?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hi! I am Pooja Yadav from India. I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering at National Institute of Technology, Goa, India. I have been interested in computer science since high school and feel lucky to get the branch of my choice in one of the deemed universities in India for my Btech degree. I like badminton and skipping in sports and I was a national player in rope skipping at my high school. Sometimes, to relax myself I draw sketches and play with paints sometimes. It is really therapeutic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am also a supporter of equity and diversity in the tech field. I am the General Secretory of SPIE student chapter of our college and we have organised many events to support equity. diversity and inclusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>How did you hear about Outreachy and why did you apply?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I heard about Outreachy in my second year of college from one of my seniors who is also an Outreachy alum. So, I also thought about participating in it. Outreachy provides great opportunity to people subjected to systematic bias and underrepresented in the technical industry. This was what encouraged me to participate in it. I got introduced to the vast ocean of computer science field in my first year of college and It seemed so overwhelming to me. So, I thought Outreachy would be a good place to start and that is how I got introduced to open source. I tried for Outreachy internship last year also but my final application was not selected. However, I learned a lot of things and was determined to try this year as well. I met many amazing people during the contribution period. All mentors and participants were very friendly and it was always a pleasure to talk to them. Mentors were very patient to answer all my questions, even the dumbest one. Also, the projects were so exciting and I wanted to dive into one of them because I knew that would raise my learning curve to another level. And this year the LLVM project on which I would be working got my interest. So, I decided to contribute to it and luckily I got selected for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Which project will you be working on?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project on which I am working is &amp;lsquo;Create Documentation and Tutorials for the LLVM Global Instruction Selection Framework&amp;rsquo;. Working on it was quite adventurous during my contribution period and currently I am learning a lot of things. This project is about reading present documentation of GlobalISel and updating or making the required changes. Then make a good tutorial for GIobalISel which would help many contributors in future; beginners as well as professionals. For creating documentation and tutorials I have to understand everything about GlobalIsel. So I am learning along as I move ahead in my project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>What are you most looking forward to during your internship?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had never heard about LLVM IR before. When I first read about it I was intrigued by the idea of improving the performance of a compiler with one more intermediate representation i.e machine IR and how we can write a generalised IR for compilers so that we don&amp;rsquo;t need to do it from scratch for every backend. I have learnt many things while working on this project, which include other things apart from this project topic like the concept of compilers, git, open source contributing rules, interaction with other contributors, communication skills, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am looking forward to learning more about this project and contributing my best to it. I like to explore different fields and this is a great opportunity to observe what other contributors are doing and learn from their project as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Smaller debug info with constructor type homing</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2021-04-05-constructor-homing-for-debug-info/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2021-04-05-constructor-homing-for-debug-info/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="constructor-type-homing-for-debug-info">Constructor type homing for debug info&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="background">Background&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Class type information is a large contributor to debug info size. Clang already has a few optimizations to reduce the size of class type information based on the assumption that debug info can be spread out over multiple compilation units. So, instead of emitting class type info in every compilation unit that references a class, we only really have to emit it in one place. (For all the other references, emitting the much smaller forward declaration of the class is sufficient.) As an example, one of the existing optimizations is vtable homing, where the type info for a dynamic C++ class is only emitted when its vtable is emitted.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="constructor-type-homing">Constructor type homing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Constructor homing is a similar optimization that applies to almost all classes with constructors. It emits type information for a class wherever its constructor definition is emitted. Unlike with vtable homing, the type info for a class could be emitted more than once, but it has a large impact on debug info because it applies to a large percentage of classes. If all of a class&amp;rsquo;s constructors are defined out of line, the class type information will only be emitted once. If there are constructors defined inline, the inline constructors, and therefore class type information, will be emitted in every compilation unit that calls a constructor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Constructor homing assumes that if a user wants a class to have debug info, then that class was constructed somewhere in the program. This is a reasonable assumption to make, as classes viewed in the debugger probably exist in program memory, and any class that exists in memory must have been constructed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even though all classes have constructors, there are some types of classes that constructor homing doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to: trivial classes, aggregate classes, and classes with constexpr constructors. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to create instances of these classes without emitting a constructor, so we can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee that the debug info will be emitted. However, these types of classes tend to be fairly small, so we would probably see less of an improvement from using constructor homing on them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Constructor homing can be enabled with &lt;code>-Xclang -fuse-ctor-homing&lt;/code>. Eventually, the plan is to enable it by default in Clang so that it happens as part of &lt;code>-fno-standalone-debug&lt;/code>. In terms of Clang&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>-debug-info-kind=&lt;/code> flags, constructor homing is implemented as &lt;code>-debug-info-kind=constructor&lt;/code>, one level below &lt;code>-debug-info-kind=limited&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="size-improvements">Size improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Emitting less class type info gives us a significant reduction in object file sizes. In a Chrome debug build on Linux (which uses split dwarf for debug info), .o and .dwo file sizes with constructor type homing are about 30% smaller (with a 20% overall reduction in build directory size). In a Clang debug build on Linux, .o file sizes are about 48% smaller (and the overall build directory is 38% smaller). On Windows, both Chrome and Clang had 37% smaller .obj files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The smaller object file size also results in an improvement in link times and GDB load times. On Windows, linking Chrome with constructor homing is 6% faster, while linking Clang is 34% faster. On Linux there was no noticeable difference in link time in Chrome, but linking Clang is 25% faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Measured on my machine, without using &lt;code>--gdb-index&lt;/code>, the GDB load time for Clang is about 2m30s without constructor homing, and 1 minute with. If &lt;code>--gdb-index&lt;/code> is enabled, the GDB startup time is about a second regardless, and the binary size is about 30% smaller with constructor homing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="potential-pitfalls">Potential pitfalls&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ideally, constructor homing shouldn&amp;rsquo;t change the debug info that&amp;rsquo;s available when debugging, but there are some cases where it does. Even though this is undefined behavior in C++, it is possible to define a class with a non-trivial constructor and create an instance of it without calling the constructor (this is often done in C code, where there are no constructors):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Foo *p = malloc(sizeof(Foo));
p-&amp;gt;someField = 1;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The constructor for Foo is never called, so its debug info is never emitted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After enabling constructor type homing in Chrome, we discovered that there are a few classes in libc++ that avoid calling the constructor, and for various reasons, that would be difficult to change. To ensure that they still have debug info, there&amp;rsquo;s a new attribute in Clang called &lt;code>[[standalone_debug]]&lt;/code>. If a class has the attribute it will have the same debug info as if it were built with -fstandalone-debug. This can be used to get debug info for classes that otherwise would have had their type info omitted with constructor homing (or with any of the other debug info optimizations).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve also looked into whether there are other common cases where constructor homing omits debug info. Manually comparing the debug info available in a Clang build showed some missing types. There were a few classes that were not used anywhere. There were also one or two pseudo-namespace classes that only had static methods and were therefore never constructed. Looking at diffs of the debug info is somewhat difficult given how many object files and types there are (most of the missing types I saw were because the type wasn&amp;rsquo;t constructed in the particular binary or set of object files I compared), so there may have been other cases I missed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Constructor type homing is a new optimization that greatly reduces the size of debug info in object files. Currently it can be enabled with the cc1 flag &lt;code>-fuse-ctor-homing&lt;/code>, and the plan is to enable it by default as part of &lt;code>-fno-standalone-debug&lt;/code> in Clang. If you want to make your debug builds smaller, try adding &lt;code>-Xclang -fuse-ctor-homing&lt;/code> to your build and let us know how much object file size it saves.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Women in Compilers and Tools Meetup Series</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2021-03-31-womenincompilerstoolsmeetup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2021-03-31-womenincompilerstoolsmeetup/</guid><description>&lt;p>As today is the last day of Women&amp;rsquo;s History Month, it seems fitting to announce a new meetup series for Women in Compilers and Tools.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-pass-manager">What is a pass manager?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A pass manager schedules transformation passes and analyses to be run on IR in a specific order. Passes can run on an entire module, a single function, or something more abstract such as a strongly connected component (SCC) in a call graph or a loop inside of a function. Scheduling can be simple, such as running a list of module passes, or running function passes on every function inside a module. Scheduling can also be more involved, such as making sure we visit SCCs in the call graph in the correct order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A pass manager is also responsible for managing analysis results. Analyses (e.g. dominator tree) should be shared between passes whenever possible for efficiency reasons, since recomputing analyses can be expensive. To do so, the pass manager must cache results and recompute them when they are invalidated by transforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For testing purposes, we can add specific passes to a pass manager to test those passes. However, the typical use case is to run a predetermined pass pipeline. For example, &lt;code>clang -O2&lt;/code> runs a predetermined set of passes on the input IR.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-llvms-new-pass-manager">What is LLVM&amp;rsquo;s new pass manager?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>LLVM currently has two separate pass managers: the legacy pass manager (legacy PM) and the new pass manager (new PM). When referring to &amp;ldquo;legacy PM&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;new PM&amp;rdquo;, this includes all of the surrounding infrastructure, not just the entity that manages passes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The legacy PM has been in use for a very long time and did its job fairly well. However, there were some missing features required for better optimization opportunities, most notably the ability to use function analysis results for arbitrary functions from the inliner. The specific motivating use case was that the inliner wanted to look at the profile data of callees recursively, especially in regards to deferred inlining where the inliner wants to look through simple &amp;ldquo;wrapper&amp;rdquo; functions. The legacy PM did not support retrieval of analyses for arbitrary functions in a CGSCC pass. A CGSCC pass runs on a specific strongly connected component (SCC) of the call graph. The pass manager makes sure we visit SCCs bottom-up so that callees are as optimized as possible when we get to their callers and callers have as precise information as possible. LLVM&amp;rsquo;s inliner is a CGSCC pass due to being a bottom-up inliner. This major limitation of the legacy PM, along with other warts, prompted the desire for a new pass manager.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently the new PM applies only to the middle-end optimization pipeline working with LLVM IR. The backend codegen pipeline still works only with the legacy PM, mostly because most codegen passes don&amp;rsquo;t work on LLVM IR, but rather machine IR (MIR), and nobody has yet put in the time to create the new PM infrastructure for MIR passes and to migrate all of the backends to use the new PM. Migrating to the new PM for the codegen pipeline likely won&amp;rsquo;t unlock performance gains since there are almost no interprocedural codegen passes. However, it would clean up a lot of technical debt.
Design
With the legacy PM, each pass declares which analyses it requires and preserves, and the pass manager schedules those analyses as passes to be run if they aren&amp;rsquo;t currently cached or have been invalidated. Declaring ahead of time which analyses a pass may need is unnecessary boilerplate, and a pass might not end up using all analyses in all cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new PM takes a different approach of completely separating analyses and normal passes. Rather than having the pass manager take care of analyses, a separate analysis manager is in charge of computing, caching, and invalidating analyses. Passes can simply request an analysis from the analysis manager, allowing for lazily computing analyses. In order for a pass to communicate that analyses have been invalidated, it returns which analyses it has preserved. The pass manager tells the analysis manager to handle invalidated cached analyses. This results in less boilerplate and better separation of concerns between passes and analyses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the legacy PM modelled analyses as passes to be scheduled and run, we can&amp;rsquo;t efficiently access analyses to arbitrary functions. For a function analysis, the corresponding analysis pass will only contain the info for the current function, which is created during the latest run of the analysis pass. We can manually create analyses for other functions, but they won&amp;rsquo;t be cached anywhere, leading to lots of redundant work and unacceptable compile time regressions. Since analyses are handled by an analysis manager in the new PM, the analysis manager can cache arbitrary analyses for arbitrary functions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To support CGSCC analyses, we need a key to cache analyses. For things like functions and loops, we have persistent data structures for those to use as keys. However, the legacy CGSCC pass manager only stored the functions in the current SCC in memory and did not have a persistent call graph data structure to use as keys to cache analyses. So we need to keep the whole graph in memory to have something to use as a key. And if we have a persistent call graph, we need to make sure it is up to date if passes change its structure. To avoid too much redundant work regenerating a potentially large but sparse graph, we need to incrementally update the graph. This is the reason behind the complexity of the CGSCC pass manager in the new PM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within an SCC, a transform might break a call graph cycle and split the SCC. One issue with the legacy CGSCC infrastructure is that it simply stores all the functions in the current SCC in an array, then iterates through the functions in that order without ever revisiting functions. Consider the following SCC containing two functions.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>void foo() {
bar();
}
void bar() {
if (false) {
foo();
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Say we first visit foo, then visit bar and remove the dead call.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>void foo() {
bar();
}
void bar() {}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>We now want to revisit foo since we have better information, most notably that foo is in its own SCC. The legacy CGSCC pass manager would simply move on to the next part of the call graph. So as part of the new PM&amp;rsquo;s incremental call graph update, if an SCC is split, we make sure to visit the newly split SCCs bottom-up. This may involve revisiting a function we have already visited, but that is intentional as to give passes a chance to observe more precise information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When adding passes to the legacy pass manager, the nesting of different pass types is implicit. For example, adding function passes after a module pass implicitly creates a function pass manager over a contiguous list of function passes. This is fine in theory, although it can be a little confusing. And some pipelines want to run a CGSCC pass independently of a function pass that comes right after, rather than nesting the function pass into the CGSCC pass via a CGSCC pass manager. The new PM makes the nesting more explicit by only allowing pass managers to contain passes of the equivalent type. For example, a function pass manager can only contain function passes. To add a loop pass to a function pass manager, the loop pass must be wrapped in a loop-to-function adaptor to turn it into a function pass. The IR nesting in the new PM is module (-&amp;gt; CGSCC) -&amp;gt; function -&amp;gt; loop, where the CGSCC nesting is optional. Requiring the CGSCC nesting was considered to simplify things, but the extra runtime overhead of building the call graph and the extra code for proper nesting to run function passes was enough to make the CGSCC nesting optional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The legacy pass manager relies on many global flags and registries. This is supported by macros generating functions and variables to initialize passes, and any users of the legacy pass manager must make sure to call a function to initialize these passes. But we need some way for a pass manager builder to be aware of all passes for testing purposes. The way the new PM does this is by having the pass manager builder include the definitions of all passes, then use a large mapping of pass IDs to pass constructors to create a function that parses a textual description of a pipeline and adds passes. Users of a pass manager builder can add plugins that register parsing callbacks to handle custom out-of-tree passes. Although there is a global list of functions, there is no mutable global state since each pass manager builder can parse pass pipelines without going through a global registry. Other options, like debugging the execution of a pass manager, are also specified via the constructor, and not through a global flag.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There has been a desire to parallelize LLVM passes for a long time. Although the pass manager infrastructure is not the only blocker, the legacy PM did have a couple of issues blocking parallelization.
At the call graph level, only sibling SCCs can be parallelized. Creating SCCs on demand makes it hard to find sibling SCCs. The new PM&amp;rsquo;s computation of the entire call graph makes it easy to find sibling SCCs to parallelize SCC passes on.
Module analyses can be computed from function passes in the legacy PM. Some passes only use analyses if they are cached, so parallelization can cause non-determinism since a module analysis may or may not exist based on other parallel pipelines. The new PM only allows function passes to access cached module analyses and does not allow running them. This has the downside of needing to make sure that certain higher-level analyses are present before running a lower-level pipeline, e.g. making sure GlobalsAA has been computed before running a function pipeline.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="making-the-new-pass-manager-the-default-pass-manager">Making the new pass manager the default pass manager&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Some major users of LLVM switched to using the new PM by default many years ago. There were some efforts upstream to make the new PM work for all use cases. For example, all Clang tests had been passing with the new PM for a while. However, a vast majority of LLVM tests were still only testing the legacy PM. &lt;code>opt&lt;/code>, the program typically used to test passes, had syntax to run passes using the legacy PM, &lt;code>opt -instcombine&lt;/code>, and syntax to run passes using the new PM, &lt;code>opt -passes=instcombine&lt;/code>. The vast majority of tests used the legacy PM syntax, so if the new PM were to be switched on by default, most LLVM tests wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be testing the new PM passes. (a good number of tests already manually ran against both)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make tests using &lt;code>opt&lt;/code> run against the new PM, we can either manually make them run twice, once against the legacy PM and once against the new PM, or we can automatically translate &lt;code>opt -instcombine&lt;/code> to &lt;code>opt -passes=instcombine&lt;/code> when the new PM is on by default. Rather than update every test, an &lt;code>-enable-new-pm&lt;/code> option was added to &lt;code>opt&lt;/code>, which translates the legacy syntax to the new syntax.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this new option, we started discovering what features the legacy PM had that existing users of the new PM weren&amp;rsquo;t concerned with. Turning this on locally of course initially caused many tests to fail. Many passes hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet been ported to the new PM and some &lt;code>opt&lt;/code> features didn&amp;rsquo;t work with the new PM. We ported passes and features that made sense to port to the new PM, and pinned tests using legacy PM features that didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to port to the new PM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the more interesting issues with the new PM uncovered with &lt;code>-enable-new-pm&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The &lt;code>optnone&lt;/code> function attribute didn&amp;rsquo;t cause optional passes to be skipped. Using the existing pass instrumentation framework, which calls callbacks before and after running a pass, and also allows passes to be skipped, this was a very simple pass instrumentation. However, some passes must be run to preserve correctness, so we ended up marking some passes as required.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://llvm.org/docs/OptBisect.html">Opt-bisect&lt;/a> wasn&amp;rsquo;t supported in the new PM. It is used for bisecting which pass in a pipeline causes a miscompile by skipping passes after a certain point. This similarly was fairly easily implemented via pass instrumentation. This similarly always runs required passes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Various target-specific tests were failing. Upon inspection, some passes that were expected to be run in something like the -O2 pipeline weren&amp;rsquo;t being run. Some backend targets add custom passes into the default pipelines. Some of these passes are required for correctness, such as passes to lower target-specific intrinsics. The legacy PM had a way for a &lt;code>TargetMachine&lt;/code> to inject passes into default pipelines via &lt;code>TargetMachine::adjustPassManager()&lt;/code>. A new PM equivalent was introduced and the target-specific passes in the optimization pipeline were ported to the new PM. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t previously an issue because existing users of the new PM were mostly concerned with x86, which didn&amp;rsquo;t use this feature in the legacy PM.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some coroutine tests were asserting in the CGSCC infrastructure. It turns out that the new PM CGSCC infrastructure didn&amp;rsquo;t support extracting parts of a function into another (aka outlining) in a CGSCC pass. There were some initial failed attempts at hacks to work around this issue, which didn&amp;rsquo;t properly update the call graph and didn&amp;rsquo;t handle recursion from newly outlined functions. Finally we came up with a solution that fit into the existing CGSCC infrastructure and properly kept the call graph valid, although coroutine-specific call graph transformations had to be accomodated.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="improvements">Improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Various projects/companies have already been using the new PM for performance reasons for many years. Separately, Chrome recently started using PGO and ThinLTO to make Chrome faster, each with noticeable performance wins. After the new PM was turned on by default in LLVM, Chrome followed suit and turned on the new PM, seeing 3-4% improvements in Speedometer 2.0 for Linux and Windows, on top of a 8-9MB size decrease. It&amp;rsquo;s likely that better usage of profile information as well as better handling of larger ThinLTO call graphs lead to these improvements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, smaller applications with tiny hotspots likely won&amp;rsquo;t see much benefit from the new PM since the improvements brought on by the new PM tend to be more relevant to large codebases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aside from user-facing improvements, this also helps LLVM&amp;rsquo;s code health by standardizing on one of the two pass managers for the optimization. While we can&amp;rsquo;t yet remove the legacy pass manager, we can start the deprecation of it, at least for the optimization pipeline. Then hopefully at some point we can start to remove parts of the optimization pipeline that are legacy PM-specific.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">What&amp;rsquo;s next?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To begin the process of removing the use of the legacy PM in the optimization pipeline, we need to make sure that anything using the legacy PM has an alternative using the new PM. Just to list a couple: bugpoint, the LLVM C API, GPU divergence analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As mentioned before, the codegen pipeline still only works with the legacy PM. Although there has been work to start making the codegen pipeline work with the new PM, it is still very far from being usable. This is a great entry point into LLVM, please ask on llvm-dev for more information if you&amp;rsquo;re interested.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cling -- Beyond Just Interpreting C++</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2021-03-25-cling-beyond-just-interpreting-cpp/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2021-03-25-cling-beyond-just-interpreting-cpp/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="interactive-c-with-cling">Interactive C++ with Cling&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In our previous blog post &lt;a href="https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2020-12-21-interactive-cpp-for-data-science/">&amp;ldquo;Interactive C++ for Data Science&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>
we described eval-style programming, interactive C++ in Notebooks and CUDA. This
post will discuss some developed applications of Cling supporting
interoperability and extensibility. We aim to demonstrate template instantiation
on demand; embedding Cling as a service; and showcase an extension enabling
on-the-fly automatic differentiation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="template-instantiation-on-demand">Template Instantiation on Demand&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cling implements a facility called &lt;code>LookupHelper&lt;/code>, which takes C++ code and
checks if a declaration with that qualified name already exists. For instance:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">[cling] &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">#&lt;/span>include &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;cling/Interpreter/Interpreter.h&amp;#34;&lt;/span>

(cling&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>LookupHelper &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;amp;&lt;/span>) &lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">@&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0x7fcba3c0bfc0&lt;/span>
[cling] &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">auto&lt;/span> D &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> LH.findScope(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;std::vector&amp;lt;S&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,

(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">const&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">char&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">*&lt;/span>) &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;ClassTemplateSpecialization&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In this particular case, &lt;code>findScope&lt;/code> instantiates the template and returns its
clang AST representation. Template instantiation on demand addresses the common
library problem of template combinatorial explosion. Template instantiation on
demand and conversion of textual qualified C++ names into entity meta
information has proven to be a very powerful mechanism aiding data serialization
and language interoperability.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="language-interop-on-demand">Language Interop on Demand&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>An example is &lt;a href="https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/">cppyy&lt;/a>, which provides automatic
Python bindings, at runtime, to C++ code through Cling. Python is itself a
dynamic language executed by an interpreter, thus making the interaction with
C++ code more natural when intermediated by Cling. Examples include runtime
template instantiations, function (pointer) callbacks, cross-language
inheritance, automatic downcasting, and exception mapping. Many advanced C++
features such as placement new, multiple virtual inheritance,
variadic templates, etc., are naturally resolved by the LookupHelper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>cppyy achieves high performance through an all-lazy approach to runtime bindings
construction and specializations of common cases through runtime reflection.
As such, it has a much lower call overhead than e.g. pybind11, and looping over
a &lt;code>std::vector&lt;/code> through cppyy is faster than looping over a numpy array of the
same type. Taking it a step further, its implementation for PyPy, a fully
compatible Python interpreter sporting at &lt;a href="https://pypy.org">tracing JIT&lt;/a>, can
in many cases provide native access to C++ code in PyPy&amp;rsquo;s JIT, including
overload resolution and JIT hints that allow for aggressive optimizations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Cling&amp;rsquo;s runtime reflection, cppyy makes maintaining a large software
stack simpler: except for cppyy&amp;rsquo;s own python-interpreter binding, it does not
have any compiled code that is Python-dependent. I.e., cppyy-based extension
modules require no recompilation when switching Python versions (or even when
switching between the CPython and PyPy interpreters, say).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The example below shows the tight integration of C++ and python; shows the tight
back and forth communication of the template instantiation and the
cross-inheritance overrides; and the runtime behaviors (everything happens at
runtime, there is no compiled code here).&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#f92672">import&lt;/span> cppyy

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In the snippet we create python classes based on python arguments, which derive
from a templated C++ class instantiated with a type. The python class provides
the implementation for a protected function that is called from a public
function, resulting in the expected return value, which is printed. We aim to
highlight:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Python creates classes at runtime, as can Cling, even when they are
declared in a module (the relevant classes are here created in a factory
method);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Templated C++ classes can be instantiated on the fly from Python, by taking
the type of the argument (i.e. using introspection at runtime in Python) to
create the C++ base class for the Python class.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cross-language derivation is at runtime, with no support needed from the C++
class, other than a virtual destructor and virtual methods;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>C++ &amp;ldquo;protected&amp;rdquo; methods can be overridden in Python, even though Python has
no such concept and you can not actually call protected methods from bound
C++ objects in Python;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It all works straight out of the box.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>cppyy is used in several large code bases in physics, chemistry, mathematics,
and biology. It is readily installable through
[pip from PyPI] (&lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/cppyy/">https://pypi.org/project/cppyy/&lt;/a>) and through
&lt;a href="https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cppyy">conda&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another example is Symmetry Integration Language (SIL), a D-based
domain-specific language of functional flavor developed and used internally by
&lt;a href="https://symmetryinvestments.com">Symmetry Investments&lt;/a>. One of the main goals
of SIL is to be easily interoperable with all sorts of languages and systems,
and this is achieved through various plugins. To call C++ code, SIL uses a
plugin called &lt;code>sil-cling&lt;/code>, which acts as a middle ground between SIL and Cling.
However, sil-cling does not interact directly with Cling, but through
cppyy-backend, that is cppyy&amp;rsquo;s C/C++ wrapper around Cling that provides a stable
C/C++ reflection API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two core types that are exposed from sil-cling to SIL. One is
&lt;code>CPPNamespace&lt;/code>, which exposes a C++ namespace and allows free function calling,
access to namespace&amp;rsquo;s variables, and object instantiation for the classes
defined in that namespace. The other is &lt;code>ClingObj&lt;/code>, which is a proxy for a C++
object, allowing construction, method calling and the manipulation of the
object&amp;rsquo;s data members. Given that cppyy represents C++ classes, structs and
namespaces as &amp;lsquo;scopes&amp;rsquo; and reflection information about any of these C++
entities is obtained through its associated &amp;lsquo;scope&amp;rsquo; object, both wrapper types
exposed to SIL hold a reference to their associated scope object which is
queried whenever the wrapper types are used to call C++ code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the calls that are done from SIL through the two wrapper types have 3
arguments: the wrapper object used, the name of the C++ function that needs to
be called, and (if needed) a sequence of arguments for that function. Once the
overload resolution and the argument conversion are done, sil-cling calls the
appropriate cppyy function that will wrap the call and dispatch it to Cling for
JIT compilation. At the moment, sil-cling can be used to call C++ libraries like
&lt;code>Boost.Asio&lt;/code>, &lt;code>dlib&lt;/code> or &lt;code>Xapian&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The example below creates a Boost Asio-based client-server application written
in SIL using the sil-cling plugin. Server.sil contains the SIL code for the
server. It starts by including the relevant header files, using &lt;code>cppCompile&lt;/code>.
The next step is to create wrapper objects for the namespaces that are needed,
and this is done by calling cppNamespace with the names of the namespaces that
one needs to access. These CPPNamespace wrappers are used to instantiate classes
that are defined inside the C++ namespaces that they wrap. Using these wrappers,
an endpoint, an acceptor socket (which listens for incoming connections) and an
active socket (which handles communication with the client) are created. Then
the server waits for a connection and, once a client connects, it reads its
message and sends a reply.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The design of Cling, just like Clang, allows it to be used as a library. In the
next example we show how to incorporate libCling in a C++ program. Cling can be
used on-demand, as a service, to compile, modify or describe C++ code. The
example program shows several ways in which compiled and interpreted C++ can
interact:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>callCompiledFn&lt;/code> &amp;ndash; The cling-demo.cpp defines an in global variable,
&lt;code>aGlobal&lt;/code>; a static float variable, &lt;code>anotherGlobal&lt;/code>; and its accessors. The
&lt;code>interp&lt;/code> argument is an earlier created instance of the Cling interpreter.
Just like in standard C++, it is sufficient to forward declare the compiled
entities to the interpreter to be able to use them. Then, the execution
information from the different calls to process is stored in a generic Cling
&lt;code>Value&lt;/code> object which is used to exchange information between compiled and
interpreted code.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>callInterpretedFn&lt;/code> &amp;ndash; Complementing &lt;code>callCompiledFn&lt;/code>, compiled code can
call an interpreted function by asking Cling to form a function pointer from
a given mangled name. Then the call uses the standard C++ syntax.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>modifyCompiledValue&lt;/code> &amp;ndash; Cling has full understanding of C++ and thus we can
support complex low-level operations on stack-allocated memory. In the
example we ask the compiler for the memory address of the local variable loc
and ask the interpreter, at runtime, to square its value.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Crossing the compiled-interpreted boundary relies on the stability of Clang&amp;rsquo;s
implementation of the host&amp;rsquo;s application binary interface (ABI). Over the years
it has been very reliable for both Unix and Windows however, Cling is heavily
used to interact with GCC-compiled codebases and is sensitive to ABI
incompatibilities between GCC and Clang with respect to the Itanium ABI
specification.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="extensions">Extensions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Just like Clang, Cling can be extended by plugins. The next example demonstrates
embedded use of Cling&amp;rsquo;s extension for automatic differentiation,
&lt;a href="https://compiler-research.org/clad/">Clad&lt;/a>. Clad transforms the clang&amp;rsquo;s AST to
produce derivatives and gradients of mathematical functions. When creating the
Cling instance we specify -fplugin and the path to the plugin itself. Then we
define a target function, pow2, and ask for its derivative with respect to its
first argument.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We have demonstrated Cling&amp;rsquo;s capabilities for template instantiation on demand;
incorporating an interpreter in third-party code; and facilitating interpreter
extension. The lazy template instantiation in an embedded interpreter provides a
service which is very suitable for interoperability with C++. Extending such a
service with domain-specific capabilities such as automatic differentiation can
be an key enabler for various science cases and for other broader communities.&lt;/p>

It was first introduced in the proceedings of the IEEE Security and Privacy conference in 2014 (&lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6956589">publication&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/pubs/2014-ieeesp.pdf">PDF&lt;/a>) in the context of vulnerability discovery in C system code and the Linux kernel in particular. The core ideas of the approach are the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the CPG combines several program representations into one&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the CPG is stored in a graph database&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the graph database comes with a DSL allowing to traverse and query the CPG&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Currently, the CPG infrastructure is supported by several tools:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://ocular.shiftleft.io">Ocular&lt;/a> - a proprietary code analysis tool supporting Java, Scala, C#, Go, Python, and JavaScript languages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://joern.io">Joern&lt;/a> - an open-source counterpart of Ocular supporting C and C++&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://plume-oss.github.io/plume-docs/">Plume&lt;/a> - an open-source tool supporting Java Bytecode&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This article presents &lt;a href="https://www.shiftleft.io">ShiftLeft&lt;/a>&amp;lsquo;s open-source implementation of &lt;a href="https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/llvm2cpg">llvm2cpg&lt;/a> - a standalone tool that brings LLVM Bitcode support to Joern.
But before we dive into details, let us say few more words about CPG and Joern.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="code-property-graph">Code Property Graph&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The core idea of the CPG is that different classic program representations are merged into a property graph, a single data structure that holds information about the program&amp;rsquo;s syntax, control- and intra-procedural data-flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Graphically speaking, the following piece of code:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-c" data-lang="c">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">void&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">foo&lt;/span>() {
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> x &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> source();
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> (x &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;&lt;/span> MAX) {
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> y &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">2&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">*&lt;/span> x;
sink(y);
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>combines these three different representations:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.llvm.org/img/cpg/different-representations.png" alt="Different program representations">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>into a single representation - Code Property Graph:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.llvm.org/img/cpg/cpg.png" alt="Code Property Graph">&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="joern">Joern&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The property graph is stored in a graph database and made accessible via a domain-specific language (DSL) to identify programming patterns based on a DSL for graph traversals. The query language allows a seamless transition between the original code representations, making it possible to combine aspects of the code from different views these representations offer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the primary interfaces to the code property graphs is a tool called &lt;a href="https://joern.io">Joern&lt;/a>. It provides the mentioned DSL and allows to query the CPG to discover specific properties of a program.
Here are some examples of the Joern&amp;rsquo;s DSL:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We took a simple approach - let&amp;rsquo;s pretend the SSA representation is just a flat source program. In other words, the following bitcode&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-llvm" data-lang="llvm">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">define&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> @sum(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> %a, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> %a) {
%r = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">add&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">nsw&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> %a, %b
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">ret&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> %r
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>can be seen as a C program:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-c" data-lang="c">i32 &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">sum&lt;/span>(i32 a, i32 b) {
i32 r &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> add(a, b);
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> r;
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>From the high-level perspective, the approach is simple, but there are some tiny details we had to overcome.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="instruction-semantics">Instruction semantics&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We can map some of the LLVM instructions back onto the internal CPG operations. Here are some examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>add&lt;/code>, &lt;code>fadd&lt;/code> -&amp;gt; &lt;code>&amp;lt;operator&amp;gt;.addition&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>bitcast&lt;/code> -&amp;gt; &lt;code>&amp;lt;operator&amp;gt;.cast&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>fcmp eq&lt;/code>, &lt;code>icmp eq&lt;/code> -&amp;gt; &lt;code>&amp;lt;operator&amp;gt;.equals&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>urem&lt;/code>, &lt;code>srem&lt;/code>, &lt;code>frem&lt;/code> -&amp;gt; &lt;code>&amp;lt;operator&amp;gt;.modulo&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>getelementptr&lt;/code> -&amp;gt; a combination of &lt;code>&amp;lt;operator&amp;gt;.pointerShift&lt;/code>, &lt;code>&amp;lt;operator&amp;gt;.indexAccess&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>&amp;lt;operator&amp;gt;.memberAccess&lt;/code> depending on the underlying types of the GEP operand&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Most of these &lt;code>&amp;lt;operator&amp;gt;.*&lt;/code>s have special semantics, which plays a crucial role in the Joern and Ocular built-in data-flow trackers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, not every LLVM instruction has a corresponding operator in the CPG. In those cases, we had to fall back to function calls.
For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>select i1 %cond, i32 %v1, i32 %v3&lt;/code> turns into &lt;code>select(cond, v1, v2)&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>atomicrmw add i32* %ptr, i32 1&lt;/code> turns into &lt;code>atomicrmwAdd(ptr, 1)&lt;/code> (same for any other &lt;code>atomicrmw&lt;/code> operator)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>fneg float %val&lt;/code> turns into &lt;code>fneg(val)&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The only instruction we could not map to the CPG is the &lt;code>phi&lt;/code>: CPG doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a Phi node concept.
We had to eliminate &lt;code>phi&lt;/code> instructions using &lt;code>reg2mem&lt;/code> machinery.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="redundancy">Redundancy&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For a small C program&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-c" data-lang="c">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">sum&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> a, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span> b) {
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> a &lt;span style="color:#f92672">+&lt;/span> b;
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Clang emits a lot of redundant instructions by default&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-llvm" data-lang="llvm">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">define&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> @sum(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> %0, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> %1) {
%3 = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">alloca&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">align&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">4&lt;/span>
%4 = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">alloca&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">align&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">4&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">store&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> %0, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span>* %3, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">align&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">4&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">store&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> %1, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span>* %4, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">align&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">4&lt;/span>
%5 = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">load&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span>* %3, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">align&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">4&lt;/span>
%6 = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">load&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span>* %4, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">align&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">4&lt;/span>
%7 = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">add&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">nsw&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> %5, %6
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">ret&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> %7
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>instead of a more concise version&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-llvm" data-lang="llvm">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">define&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> @sum(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> %0, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> %1) {
%3 = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">add&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">nsw&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> %1, %0
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">ret&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> %3
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In general, this is not a problem, but it adds more complexity for the data-flow tracker and needlessly increases the graph&amp;rsquo;s size.
One of the considerations was to run optimizations before emitting CPG for the bitcode. Still, in the end, we decided to offload this work to an end-user: if you want fewer instructions, then apply the optimizations manually before emitting the CPG.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="type-equality">Type Equality&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The other issue is related to the way LLVM handles types. If two modules in the same context use the same struct with the same name, LLVM renames the other struct to prevent name collisions. For example&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-llvm" data-lang="llvm">&lt;span style="color:#75715e">; Module1
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span>%struct.Point = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">type&lt;/span> { &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> }
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>and&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-llvm" data-lang="llvm">&lt;span style="color:#75715e">; Module 2
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span>%struct.Point = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">type&lt;/span> { &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> }
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>when loaded into the same context yield two types&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-llvm" data-lang="llvm">%struct.Point = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">type&lt;/span> { &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> }
%struct.Point.1 = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">type&lt;/span> { &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> }
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We wanted to deduplicate these types for a better user experience and only emit &lt;code>Point&lt;/code> in the final graph.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The obvious solution was to consider two structs with &amp;ldquo;similar&amp;rdquo; names and the same layout to be the same.
However, we could not rely on the &lt;code>llvm::StructType::isLayoutIdentical&lt;/code> because, despite the name, it produces misleading results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to &lt;code>llvm::StructType::isLayoutIdentical&lt;/code> the structs &lt;code>Point&lt;/code> and &lt;code>Pair&lt;/code> have identical layout, but &lt;code>PointWrap&lt;/code> and &lt;code>PairWrap&lt;/code> are not.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-llvm" data-lang="llvm">&lt;span style="color:#75715e">; these two have identical layout
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span>%Point = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">type&lt;/span> { &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> }
%Pair = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">type&lt;/span> { &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">i32&lt;/span> }
&lt;span style="color:#75715e">; these two DO NOT have identical layout
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span>%PointWrap = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">type&lt;/span> { %Point }
%PairWrap = &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">type&lt;/span> { %Pair }
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This happens because &lt;code>llvm::StructType::isLayoutIdentical&lt;/code> determines equality based on the pointers. That is, if all the struct elements are identical, then the layout identical.
It also meant we could not use this approach to compare types from different LLVM contexts.
We had to roll out our custom solution based on the &lt;a href="https://lowlevelbits.org/type-equality-in-llvm/">Tree Automata&lt;/a> to solve this issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>There are few more details, but the article is getting longer than it needs to be.
So let&amp;rsquo;s look at how to use &lt;code>llvm2cpg&lt;/code> with Joern.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="example">Example&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once you have &lt;a href="https://docs.joern.io/installation">Joern&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/llvm2cpg/releases/latest">llvm2cpg&lt;/a> installed the usage is straightforward:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Convert a program into LLVM Bitcode&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Emit CPG&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Load the CPG into Joern and start the analysis&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Here are the steps codified:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ cat main.c
extern int MAX;
extern int source&lt;span style="color:#f92672">()&lt;/span>;
extern void sink&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>int&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>;
void foo&lt;span style="color:#f92672">()&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">{&lt;/span>
int x &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> source&lt;span style="color:#f92672">()&lt;/span>;
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">if&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>x &amp;lt; MAX&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">{&lt;/span>
int y &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">2&lt;/span> * x;
sink&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>y&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>;
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">}&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">}&lt;/span>
$ clang -S -emit-llvm -g -O1 main.c -o main.ll
$ llvm2cpg -output&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>/tmp/cpg.bin.zip main.ll
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now you get the CPG saved at &lt;code>/tmp/cpg.bin.zip&lt;/code> which you can load into Joern and find if there is a flow from the &lt;code>source&lt;/code> function to the &lt;code>sink&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ joern
joern&amp;gt; importCpg&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;/tmp/cpg.bin.zip&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>
joern&amp;gt; run.ossdataflow
joern&amp;gt; def source &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> cpg.call&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;source&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>

&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;_____________________________________________________

&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Which indeed exists!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>To conclude, let us outline some of the advantages and constraints implied by LLVM Bitcode:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the &amp;ldquo;surface&amp;rdquo; of the LLVM language is smaller than that of C and C++&lt;/li>
&lt;li>many high-level details do not exist at the IR level&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the program must be compiled, thus limiting the range of programs that one can analyze with Joern&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The LLVM Foundation is excited to announce &lt;a href="https://community-dot-o.llvm.org">Community.o&lt;/a>! This is a new face to the &lt;a href="https://foundation.llvm.org">LLVM Foundation’s&lt;/a> Diversity and Inclusion and Women in Compilers and Tools program. We’ve adopted a name to represent what this program hopes to accomplish which is to build a strong, healthy, and diverse open source community. We believe that this can only be achieved by including people from all backgrounds, genders, and experiences and by ensuring that everyone feels welcome, included, and empowered to contribute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why &lt;a href="https://community-dot-o.llvm.org">Community.o?&lt;/a> The name is inspired by the compilation model where object files link together for a final program, much like how folks from different backgrounds come together to make up llvm’s community and shared goal of inclusivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While our main focus is on the &lt;a href="https://llvm.org">LLVM community&lt;/a> and the field of compilers and tools, we want to collaborate with other open source communities and provide resources and exchange ideas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are you interested in learning more, getting involved with Community.o or joining a specific group such as Women in Compilers and Tools? Please see the &lt;a href="https://community-dot-o.llvm.org">Community.o website&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://blog.llvm.org/img/SummitLogo.png" alt="Community.o Summit">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On March 8-10, we will host our first &lt;a href="https://llvm.swoogo.com/community-o-summit/">Community.o Summit&lt;/a>! This 3-day virtual event is an inclusive space for underrepresented groups and newcomers, anywhere in their career, interested in learning and contributing to compilers, tools, and programming languages. We’ll highlight members from different open source communities making incredible efforts to support a thriving environment. Summit attendees will enjoy interesting talks, panels, workshops, and have ample networking opportunities. Additionally, this summit will be engaging for anyone interested in increasing the diversity within the LLVM community or their related affiliations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the event is free, attendance is limited to provide the best experience for attendees and allow for better collaboration and networking. Please see the &lt;a href="https://llvm.swoogo.com/community-o-summit/">Community.o Summit&lt;/a> website for more information and to apply to attend by February 26, 2021.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bringing Stack Clash Protection to Clang / X86 — the Open Source Way</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2021-01-05-stack-clash-protection/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2021 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2021-01-05-stack-clash-protection/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="context">Context&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Stack clash is an attack that dates back to 2017, when the Qualys Research Team
released an advisory with a &lt;a href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-research/2017/06/19/the-stack-clash">joint blog post&lt;/a>. It basically
exploits large stack allocation (greater than &lt;code>PAGE_SIZE&lt;/code>) that can lead to
stack read/write &lt;em>not&lt;/em> triggering the &lt;a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/6/22/345">stack guard page&lt;/a> allocated by the Linux
Kernel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shortly after the advisory got released, GCC provided a &lt;a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/legacy-ml/gcc-patches/2017-07/msg00556.html">countermeasure&lt;/a> activated by &lt;code>-fstack-clash-protection&lt;/code> that
basically consists in splitting large allocation in chunks of &lt;code>PAGE_SIZE&lt;/code>,
with a probe in each chunk to trigger the kernel stack guard page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This has been a major security difference between GCC and Clang since then. It
has even been identified as a blocker by Fedora to move from GCC to Clang as the
compiler for some projects that already made the move upstream, leading to &lt;a href="https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/2020">extra
maintenance&lt;/a> for packagers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Support for this flag &lt;a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D68720">landed in Clang in 2020&lt;/a>,
only for X86, SystemZ and PowerPC. Its implementation is a result of a fruitful
collaboration between LLVM, Firefox and Rust developers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rust already had a countermeasure implemented in the form of a runtime call to
perform the stack probing. With LLVM catching up, using a more lightweight
approach got &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77885">investigated in Rust&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="countermeasure-description">Countermeasure Description&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The Clang implementation for X86 is derived from the GCC implementation, with a
few distinctions. The core ideas are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>thanks to X86 calling convention, we get a free probe at each call site,
which means that each function starts with a probed stack&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>when probing the stack in the function prologue, we don&amp;rsquo;t probe the tail of
the allocation. Stated otherwise, if the stack size is &lt;code>PAGE_SIZE + PAGE_SIZE/2&lt;/code>,
we want to probe only once. This is important to limit the number
of probes: if the stack size is lower than &lt;code>PAGE_SIZE&lt;/code> no probe is needed&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>because a signal can interrupt the execution flow any time, at no point
should we have two stack allocations (lower than &lt;code>PAGE_SIZE&lt;/code>) without a probe
in between.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The probing strategy for stack allocation varies based on the size of the stack
allocation. If it&amp;rsquo;s smaller than &lt;code>PAGE_SIZE&lt;/code>, thanks to (2) no probing is
needing. If it&amp;rsquo;s below a small multiple of &lt;code>PAGE_SIZE&lt;/code>, then the probing loop
can be unrolled. Otherwise a probing loop alternates stack allocation of
&lt;code>PAGE_SIZE&lt;/code> bytes and probe, starting with the allocation thanks to (1).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As side effect of (2) is that when performing a dynamic allocation, we need to
probe &lt;em>before&lt;/em> updating the stack, otherwise we got a hole in the protection.
This probe cannot be done after the stack update, even with an offset, because
of (3). Otherwise we end up with a bug as this one found in &lt;a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=97928">GCC&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following scheme attempts to summarize the allocation and probing
interaction between static and dynamic allocations:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> + ----- &amp;lt;- ------------ &amp;lt;- ------------- &amp;lt;- ------------ +
| |
[free probe] -&amp;gt; [page alloc] -&amp;gt; [alloc probe] -&amp;gt; [tail alloc] + -&amp;gt; [dyn probe] -&amp;gt; [page alloc] -&amp;gt; [dyn probe] -&amp;gt; [tail alloc] +
| |
+ &amp;lt;- ----------- &amp;lt;- ------------ &amp;lt;- ----------- &amp;lt;- ------------ +
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h1 id="validation-with-firefox">Validation with Firefox&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Firefox provides an amazing test bench to evaluate the impact of compiler
changes. Indeed, with more than 12MLOC of C/C++ and 3MLOC of Rust built using
PGO/LTO and &lt;a href="https://blog.llvm.org/2019/09/closing-gap-cross-language-lto-between.html">XLTO&lt;/a>, most of the important cases are covered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, Firefox being supported on a large set of operating system and
architectures, it was a great way to test the Stack Clash protection on various
set of configurations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The work is detailed in the &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1588710">bug 1588710&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="functional-testing">Functional Testing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To make sure that Firefox would perform as expected, we leveraged the huge test
suite to verify that the product would still work as expected with this option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We used the &lt;a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/07/testing-firefox-more-efficiently-with-machine-learning/">&lt;code>try auto&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, a new command which will run the most
appropriate set of tests for such kind of changes during the development phase.
Then, once the patch landed into Mozilla-central (Firefox nightly), the whole
test suite is executed, presenting about 29 days of machine time for about 9000
tasks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to this infrastructure, we have identified an &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1588710#c40">issue with
&lt;code>alloca(0)&lt;/code>&lt;/a> generating buggy machine code.
Fortunately, the &lt;a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47657">fix&lt;/a> was already in the trunk version of LLVM.
We cherry-picked the fix in our custom Clang build which addressed our issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="performance-testing">Performance Testing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the years, Mozilla has developed a few tools to evaluate performance
impact of changes, from micro-benchmark to page loads. These tools have been key
to improve Firefox overall performances but also evaluate the impact of the &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/nfroyd/2018/05/29/when-implementation-monoculture-right-thing/">move
to Clang&lt;/a> on all platforms done a couple years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The usual procedure to evaluate performances improvements/regressions is to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Run two builds with benchmarks. One without the patch, one with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Leverage the tooling to rerun the benchmark (usually 5 to 20 times) to limit
the noise.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Compare the various benchmark to see if significant regressions can be
identified.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In the context of this project, we run the usual benchmarks sensitive to C++
changes and we haven&amp;rsquo;t identified any &lt;a href="https://treeherder.mozilla.org/perfherder/comparesubtest?originalProject=try&amp;amp;newProject=try&amp;amp;newRevision=62108fa48bd15fe01f1a0f1ffab133af9b4207cc&amp;amp;originalSignature=1904137&amp;amp;newSignature=1904137&amp;amp;framework=10&amp;amp;originalRevision=a47c98b909b61035dae2e1e00883f2ade0fef129">regression&lt;/a> in term of
performances.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="current-status">Current status&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Firefox nightly on Linux is now compiled with the stack-clash-option from
January 8th 2021. We have not detected any regressions since it landed.
If everything goes well, this change should ship with Firefox 86 (planned for
mid February 2021).&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="validation-with-rust">Validation With Rust&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Rust has long supported the callback style of the LLVM &lt;code>probe-stack&lt;/code> attribute,
using the function &lt;code>__rust_probestack&lt;/code> defined in its own compiler builtins
library. In Rust&amp;rsquo;s spirit of safety, this attribute is added to &lt;em>all&lt;/em> functions,
letting LLVM sort out which actually need probing. However, forcing such a call
into every function with a large stack frame is not ideal for performance,
especially for those cases that could use just a few unrolled probes inline.
Furthermore, Rust only has this callback implemented for its Tier 1 (most
supported) targets, namely i686 and x86_64, leaving other architectures without
protection so far. Therefore, letting LLVM generate inline stack probes is
beneficial both for the performance of avoiding a call and for the increased
architecture support.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the Rust compiler is written in Rust itself, with stack probing enabled by
default, it makes a great functional test for any new code generation feature.
The compiler is bootstrapped in stages, first building with a prior version,
then rebuilding with the result of that first stage. Codegen issues are often
revealed if the compiler crashes during that rebuild, and experiments with
inline stack probes were no different, leading to fixes in
&lt;a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D82867">D82867&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D90216">D90216&lt;/a>. Both of these were simple errors that
were not apparent in existing FileCheck tests, showing the importance of
actually executing generated code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/70143">issue&lt;/a> also led to the realization that there was a more
general bug impacting both GCC and LLVM implementation of
&lt;code>-fstack-clash-protector&lt;/code>, leading to a new patch set on the LLVM side.
Essentially, the observed behavior is the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alignment requirements behave similarly to allocation with respect to the stack:
they (may) make it grow. For instance the stack allocation for an &lt;code>char foo[4096] __attribute__((aligned(2048)));&lt;/code> is done through:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>and rsp, -2048
sub rsp, 6024
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Both &lt;code>and&lt;/code> and the &lt;code>sub&lt;/code> actually update the stack! To take that effect into
account, the LLVM patch considers the &lt;code>and rsp, -2048&lt;/code> as a &lt;code>sub rsp, 2048&lt;/code>
when computing the probing distance, which means considering the worst
case scenario.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For future work on the Rust side, inline stack probes will replace
&lt;code>__rust_probestack&lt;/code> on i686 and x86_64 soon in &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77885">Rust
pr77885&lt;/a>, and that will include
&lt;a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/">perf results&lt;/a> to monitor the effect. After that,
additional architectures can be functionally tested and enabled for inline stack
probes as well, increasing the reach of Rust&amp;rsquo;s memory safety.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="validation-with-a-binary-tracer">Validation with a Binary Tracer&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>None of the above validation validates the security aspect of the protection. To
have more confidence on the actual probing scheme implementation, we implemented
a binary tracer based on the (awesome) &lt;a href="https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI">QBDI&lt;/a>
Dynamic Binary Instrumentation framework. This Proof Of Concept (POC) is
available on GitHub:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/serge-sans-paille/stack-clash-tracer">stack-clash-tracer&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This tool instruments all stack allocation and memory access of a running
binary, logs them and checks that no stack allocation is greater than
&lt;code>PAGE_SIZE&lt;/code> and that we get an actual probing between two allocations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a sample session that showcases large stack allocation issues:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ cat main.c
#include &amp;lt;alloca.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;string.h&amp;gt;
int main(int argc, char**argv) {
char buffer[5000];
strcpy(buffer, argv[0]);
char* dynbuffer = alloca(argc * 1000);
strcpy(dynbuffer, argv[0]);
return buffer[argc] + dynbuffer[argc];
}
$ gcc main.c -o main
$ LD_PRELOAD=./libstack_clash_tracer.so ./main 1
[sct][error] stack allocation is too big (5024)
$ LD_PRELOAD=./libstack_clash_tracer.so ./main 1 2 3 4 5
[sct][error] stack allocation is too big (5024)
[sct][error] stack allocation is too big (6016)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The same code, compiled with &lt;code>-fstack-clash-protection&lt;/code>, is safer (apart from
the stupid use of &lt;code>strcpy&lt;/code>, that is)&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ gcc main.c -fstack-clash-protection -o main
$ LD_PRELOAD=./libstack_clash_tracer.so ./main 1
$ LD_PRELOAD=./libstack_clash_tracer.so ./main 1 2 3 4 5
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Small bonus of this compiler-independent approach: we can verify both GCC and
Clang implementation &lt;code>:-)&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ clang main.c -fstack-clash-protection -o main
$ LD_PRELOAD=./libstack_clash_tracer.so ./main 1
$ LD_PRELOAD=./libstack_clash_tracer.so ./main 1 2 3 4 5
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>To come back on the Firefox test case, before we landed the change, we could
see:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>$ LD_PRELOAD=./libstack_clash_tracer.so firefox-bin
[sct][error] stack allocation is too big (4168)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Once Firefox nightly shipped with stack clash protection, this warning
disappears.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Aside from the technical aspects of the countermeasure, it is interesting to
note that its Clang implementation was derived from the GCC implementation, but
led to an issue being reported in the GCC codebase. The Clang-generated code got
validated by Firefox People, tested by Rust people who reported several bugs,
some impacting both Clang and GCC implementation, the circle is complete!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In our previous blog post &lt;a href="https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2020-11-30-interactive-cpp-with-cling/">&amp;ldquo;Interactive C++ with Cling&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>
we mentioned that exploratory programming is an effective way to reduce the
complexity of the problem. This post will discuss some applications of Cling
developed to support data science researchers. In particular, interactively
probing data and interfaces makes complex libraries and complex data more
accessible to users. We aim to demonstrate some of Cling’s features at scale;
Cling’s eval-style programming support; projects related to Cling; and show
interactive C++/CUDA.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="eval-style-programming">Eval-style programming&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A Cling instance can access itself through its runtime. The example creates a
&lt;code>cling::Value&lt;/code> to store the execution result of the incremented variable &lt;code>i&lt;/code>.
That mechanism can be used further to support dynamic scopes extending the name
lookup at runtime.&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This mechanism introduces a delayed until runtime evaluation which enables some
features increasing the dynamic look and feel of the C++ language.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-root-data-analysis-package">The ROOT data analysis package&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The main tool for storage, research and visualization of scientific data in the
field of high energy physics (HEP) is the specialized software package &lt;a href="https://root.cern">ROOT&lt;/a>.
ROOT is a set of interconnected components that assist scientists from data
storage and research to their visualization when published in a scientific
paper. ROOT has played a significant role in scientific discoveries such as
gravitational waves, the great cavity in the Pyramid of Cheops, the discovery of
the Higgs boson by the Large Hadron Collider. For the last 5 years, Cling has
helped to analyze 1 EB physical data, serving as a basis for over 1000
scientific publications, and supports software run across a distributed million
CPU core computing facility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ROOT uses Cling as a reflection information service for data serialization. The
C++ objects are stored in a binary format, vertically. The content of a loaded
data file is made available to the users and C++ objects become a first class
citizen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A central component of ROOT enabled by Cling is eval-style programming. We use
this in HEP to make it easy to inspect and use C++ objects stored by ROOT.
Cling enables ROOT to inject available object names into the name lookup when
a file is opened:&lt;/p>

First, it builds an invalid AST by marking the occurrence of ntuple (#1), then
it is transformed into
&lt;code>gCling-&amp;gt;EvaluateT&amp;lt;/*return type*/void&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;ntuple-&amp;gt;GetTitle()&amp;quot;, /*context*/);&lt;/code>
On the next stage, at runtime, ROOT opens the file, reads its preambule and
injects the names via the external name lookup facility in clang. The
transformation becomes more complex if &lt;code>ntuple-&amp;gt;GetTitle()&lt;/code> takes arguments.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html">Jupyter Notebook&lt;/a>
technology allows users to create and share documents that contain live code,
equations, visualizations and narrative text. It enables data scientists to
easily exchange ideas or collaborate by sharing their analyses in a
straight-forward and reproducible way. Language agnosticism is a key design
principle for the Jupyter project, and the Jupyter frontend communicates with
the kernel (the part of the infrastructure that runs the code) through a
well-specified protocol. Kernels have been developed for dozens of programming
languages, such as R, Julia, Python, Fortran (through the LLVM-based LFortran
project).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s official C++ kernel relies on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus">Xeus&lt;/a>,
a C++ implementation of the kernel protocol, and Cling. An advantage of using a
reference implementation for the kernel protocol is that a lot of features come
for free, such as rich mime type display, interactive widgets, auto-complete,
and much more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rich mime-type rendering for user-defined types can be specified by providing
an overload of &lt;code>mime_bundle_repr&lt;/code> for the said type, which is picked up by
argument dependent lookup.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Xeus and Xeus-cling kernels were recently incorporated as subprojects to
Jupyter, and are governed by its code of conduct and general governance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Planned future developments for the xeus-cling kernel include: adding support
for the Jupyter console interface, through an implementation of the Jupyter
&lt;code>is_complete&lt;/code> message, currently lacking; adding support for cling

was recently added to the Jupyter kernel protocol, which will enable the use of
the JupyterLab visual debugger with the C++ kernel.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Cling CUDA extension brings the workflows of interactive C++ to GPUs without
losing performance and compatibility to existing software. To execute CUDA C++
Code, Cling activates an extension in the compiler frontend to understand the
CUDA C++ dialect and creates a second compiler instance that compiles the code
for the GPU.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Like the normal C++ mode, the CUDA C++ mode uses AST transformation to enable
interactive CUDA C++ or special features as the Cling print system. In contrast
to the normal Cling compiler pipeline used for the host code, the device
compiler pipeline does not use all the transformations of the host pipeline.
Therefore, the device pipeline has some special transformation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A special property of Cling in CUDA mode is that the Cling application becomes a
normal CUDA application at the time of the first CUDA API call. This enables the
CUDA SDK with Cling. For example, you can use the CUDA profiler
&lt;code>nvprof ./cling -xcuda&lt;/code> to profile your interactive application.
&lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sehrig/cling">This docker&lt;/a> container can be used to

&lt;p>Planned future developments for the CUDA mode include: Supporting of the
complete current CUDA API; Redefining CUDA Kernels; Supporting other GPU SDK&amp;rsquo;s
like HIP (AMD) and SYCL (Intel).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We see the use of Interactive C++ as an important tool to develop for
researchers in the data science community. Cling has enabled ROOT to be the
&amp;ldquo;go to&amp;rdquo; data analysis tool in the field of High Energy Physics for everything
from efficient I/O to plotting and fitting. The interactive CUDA backend allows
easy integration of research workflows and simpler communication between C++ and
CUDA. As Jupyter Notebooks have become a standard way for data analysts to
explore ideas, Xeus-cling ensures that great interactive C++ ingredients are
available in every C++ notebook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the next blog post we will focus on Cling enabling features beyond
interactive C++, and in particular language interoperability.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The C++ programming language is used for many numerically intensive scientific
applications. A combination of performance and solid backward compatibility has
led to its use for many research software codes over the past 20 years. Despite
its power, C++ is often seen as difficult to learn and inconsistent with rapid
application development. Exploration and prototyping is slowed down by the long
edit-compile-run cycles during development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/root-project/cling/">Cling&lt;/a> has emerged as a recognized
capability that enables interactivity, dynamic interoperability and rapid
prototyping capabilities to C++ developers. Cling supports the full C++ feature
set including the use of templates, lambdas, and virtual inheritance. Cling is
an interactive C++ interpreter, built on top of the Clang and &lt;a href="llvm.org">LLVM&lt;/a>
compiler infrastructure. The interpreter enables interactive exploration and
makes the C++ language more welcoming for research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main tool for storage, research and visualization of scientific data in the
field of high energy physics (HEP) is the specialized software package
&lt;a href="root.cern/">ROOT&lt;/a>. ROOT is a set of interconnected components that assist
scientists from data storage and research to their visualization when published
in a scientific paper. ROOT has played a significant role in scientific
discoveries such as gravitational waves, the great cavity in the Pyramid of
Cheops, the discovery of the Higgs boson by the Large Hadron Collider. For the
last 5 years, Cling has helped to analyze 1 EB physical data, serving as a basis
for over 1000 scientific publications, and supports software run across a
distributed million CPU core computing facility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently we started a project aiming to leverage our experience in interactive
C++, just-in-time compilation technology (JIT), dynamic optimizations, and large
scale software development to greatly reduce the impedance mismatch between C++
and Python. We will generalize Cling to offer a robust, sustainable and
omnidisciplinary solution for C++ language interoperability.The scope of our
objectives is to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>advance the interpretative technology to provide a state-of-the-art C++
execution environment,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>enable functionality which can provide native-like, dynamic runtime
interoperability between C++ and Python (and eventually other languages such
as Julia and Swift)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>allow seamless utilization of heterogeneous hardware (such as hardware
accelerators)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Project results will be integrated into the widely used tools LLVM, Clang and
Cling. The outcome of the proposed work is a platform which provides a C++
compiler as a service (CaaS) for both rapid application development and
computational performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rest of this post intends to demonstrate the design and several features of
Cling. Want to follow along? You can get cling from conda&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install cling
conda install llvmdev=5.0.0
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>or from docker-hub if you don&amp;rsquo;t already use conda:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>docker pull compilerresearch/cling
docker run -t -i compilerresearch/cling
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Either way, type &amp;ldquo;cling&amp;rdquo; to start its interactive shell:&lt;/p>

cling in further parts of this post.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="interpreting-c">Interpreting C++&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Exploratory programming (or Rapid Application Development) is an effective way
to gain understanding of the requirements for a project; to reduce the
complexity of the problem; and to provide an early validation of the system
design and implementation. In particular, interactively probing data and
interfaces makes complex libraries and complex data more accessible to users.
It is important in data science, computational science and debugging. It
significantly reduces the time consumed by edit-run cycles during development.
In practice, only few programming languages offer both a compiler and an
interpreter translating them into machine code, although whether a language is
to be interpreted or compiled is a property of the implementation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Languages which enable exploratory programming tend to have interpreters which
shorten the compile-link cycle; this generally has a noticeable cost in
performance. Language developers who acknowledge the use case of exploratory
programming may also put syntactic sugar, but that is mostly for convenience and
terseness. The performance penalty is largely mitigated by using just-in-time
(JIT) or ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the sake of this post series, interpreting C++ means enabling exploratory
programming for C++ while mitigating the performance cost with JIT compilation.
Figure 1 shows an illustrative example of exploratory programming. It becomes
trivial to orient the shape, choose size and color or compare to previous
settings. The invisible compile-link cycle aids interactive use which allows
some qualitatively different approaches to program development and enhanced
productivity.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="design-principles">Design principles&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Some of the design goals of cling include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do not pay for what you do not use &amp;ndash; prioritize performance of processing
correct code. For example, in order to provide error recovery do not penalize
users typing syntactically and semantically correct C++; and interactive C++
transformations are only done when necessary and can be disabled.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reuse Clang &amp;amp; LLVM at (almost) any cost &amp;ndash; do not reinvent the wheel. If a
feature is not available, then try finding a minimalistic way to implement it
and propose it for a review to the LLVM community. Otherwise find the minimal
patch, even at the cost of misusing API, which satisfies the requirements.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Continuous feature delivery &amp;ndash; focus on a minimal feature, its integration
in the main use-case (ROOT), deployment in production, repeat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Library design &amp;ndash; allow Cling to be used as a library from third party
frameworks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Learn and evolve &amp;ndash; experiment with user experience. There is no formal
specification or consensus on overall user experience. Apply lessons learned
from the legacy from CINT.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="architecture">Architecture&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cling accepts partial input and ensures that the compiler process keeps running
to act on code as it comes in. It includes an API providing access to the
properties of recently compiled chunks of code. Cling can apply custom
transformations to each chunk before execution. Cling orchestrates the existing
LLVM and Clang infrastructure following a data flow described in Figure 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="max-width:600px; margin:0 auto;">

Figure 2. Information flow in Cling
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
In short:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The tool controls the input infrastructure by interactive prompt or by an
interface allowing the incremental processing of input (➀).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It sends the input to the underlying clang library for compilation (➁).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clang compiles the input, possibly wrapped into a function, into an AST (➂).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When necessary the AST is further transformed in order to attach specific
behavior (➃).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>For example, reporting execution results, or other interpreter-related features.
Once the high-level AST representation is ready, it is sent for lowering to an
LLVM-specific assembly format, the LLVM IR (➄). The LLVM IR is the input format
for LLVM’s just-in-time compilation infrastructure. Cling instructs the JIT to
run specified functions (➅), translating them into machine code (MC) targeting
the underlying device architecture (eg. Intel x86 or NVPTX) (➆,➇).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The C++ standard is developed towards compilers and does not cover interactive
use well. Execution of statements on the global scope, reporting execution
results, and entity redefinitions are the three most important features when it
comes to user friendliness. Long running interpreter sessions are prone to
typing errors and make flawless error recovery essential. More advanced
use-cases require extra flexibility at runtime and lookup rules extensions
aiding eval-style programming. Efficient watermark-based code removal is
important when C++ is used as scripting language.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="execution-of-statements">Execution of statements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cling processes C++ incrementally. Incremental input consists of one or multiple
C++ statements. C++ does not allow expressions in the global scope.&lt;/p>

is executed as is. Internally to Cling, the example is transformed to:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="reporting-execution-results">Reporting execution results&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>An integral part of interactivity is printing expression values. Typing &lt;code>printf&lt;/code>
each time is laborious and does not naturally include object type information.
Instead, omitting the semicolon of the last statement of the input tells Cling
to report the expression result. When wrapping the input, Cling textually
attaches a semicolon to the end of it. If an execution report is requested the
corresponding wrapper AST does not contain a &lt;em>NullStmt&lt;/em> (modelling extra
semicolons).&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>A transformation injects extra code depending on the properties of the
particular entity such as if it is copyable, if it is a wrapper temporary or an
array. Cling can report information about non-copyable or temporary objects by
providing a ‘managed’ storage. The managed storage (&lt;em>cling::Value&lt;/em>) is also used
for exchanging values between interpreted and compiled code in embedded setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="entity-redefinition">Entity Redefinition&lt;/h2>

notebook-based C++ as each cell is a somewhat separate computation. C++ does not
support redefinitions of entities.&lt;/p>

(&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3377555.3377901">ACM conference on Compiler Construction&lt;/a>).
We enable it by calling &lt;code>gCling-&amp;gt;allowRedefinition()&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="invalid-code-error-recovery">Invalid Code. Error Recovery&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When used in interactive mode, invalid C++ does not terminate the session.
Instead invalid code is discarded. The underlying clang process keeps the
invalid AST nodes in its internal data structures for better error diagnostics
and recovery, expecting the process will end shortly after issuing the
diagnostics. This particular example is more challenging because it first
contains both valid and invalid constructs. The error recovery should undo a
significant amount of changes in internal structures such as the name lookup and
the AST. Cling is used in many high-performance environments; using
checkpointing is not a viable option as it introduces overhead for correct code.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>cling&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#75715e">#include &amp;lt;vector&amp;gt;&lt;/span>

~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In order to handle the example, Cling models the incremental input into a
&lt;em>Transaction&lt;/em>. A transaction represents the delta of the changes of internal
data structures of Clang. Cling listens to events coming from various Clang
callbacks such as declaration creation, deserialization and macro definition.
This information is sufficient to undo the changes and continue with a valid
state. The implementation is very intricate and in many cases requires extra
work depending on the input declaration kinds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cling also protects against null pointer dereferences via a code transformation,
avoiding a session crash.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>cling&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span> int *p &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> nullptr; *p

&lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>cling&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The implementation of error recovery and code unloading still has rough edges
and it is being improved constantly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="code-removal">Code Removal&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Incremental, interactive C++ assumes long lived sessions where not only syntax
error can happen but also semantic ones. That poses one level of extra
complexity if we want to re-execute the same code with minor adjustments.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">[cling] .L Adder.h &lt;span style="color:#75715e">// #1, similar to #include &amp;#34;Adder.h&amp;#34;

&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">int&lt;/span>) &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">4&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In the example, we include a header file with the &lt;em>.L&lt;/em> meta command;
&amp;ldquo;uninclude&amp;rdquo; it with &lt;em>.U&lt;/em> and “reinclude” it with &lt;em>.L&lt;/em> to re-read the modified
file. Unlike in the error recovery case, Cling cannot fence the machine code
lowering infrastructure and needs to undo state changes in clang CodeGen and the
llvm JIT and machine code infrastructure. The implementation of this feature
requires expertise in a big portion of the LLVM toolchain.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Cling has been one of the systems enabling interactive C++ for more than a decade.
Cling’s extensibility and fast prototyping features is of fundamental importance
for researchers in high-energy physics, and an enabler for many of the
technologies that they rely on. Cling has several unique features tailored to
the challenges which come with incremental C++. Our work on interactive C++ is
always evolving. In the next blog post we will focus on interactive C++ for Data
Science; Eval-Style Programming; Interactive CUDA; and C++ in notebooks.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Kit Barton&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kristof Beyls&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mike Edwards (Treasurer)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hal Finkel&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cyndy Ishida&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Anton Korobeynikov&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tanya Lattner (President)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chris Lattner&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tom Stellard (Secretary)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Three new members and six continuing members were elected to the nine person board. Thank you to retiring board members Chandler Carruth, Arnaud de Grandmaison, and John Regehr for all of their contributions to the board.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were pleased to have many qualified applicants to the Board of Directors this year, which enabled us to make the board stronger than ever. Unfortunately, this also meant that we could not include everyone that we wanted to. Our goal was to create a balanced board of individuals from a wide range of backgrounds and locations, and to provide a voice to many groups within the LLVM community. This is always a challenge with such a large and vibrant community, and such a small board.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About the board of directors (listed alphabetically by last name):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Kit Barton:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kit Barton has been contributing to LLVM since 2015. His contributions have primarily been to the PowerPC backend and loop optimizations including the loop fusion pass. He has presented multiple technical talks, and tutorials at the
LLVM Dev conferences over the last two years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to the contributions to LLVM, over the last two years Kit has driven the effort within IBM to migrate their proprietary C/C++ and Fortran compilers to leverage LLVM technology. He has also been involved in organizing the LLVM Meetups in Toronto as well as the Loop Optimization Working Group.&lt;/p>

&lt;b>Author&lt;/b>: &lt;a href="mailto:erich.keane@intel.com" rel="nofollow">Erich Keane&lt;/a>, Compiler Frontend Engineer, Intel Corporation&lt;br />&lt;br />Earlier this month I finally committed a patch to implement the extended-integer type class, &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">_ExtInt&lt;/span> after nearly two and a half years of design and implementation. These types allow developers to use custom width integers, such as a 13-bit signed integer. This patch is currently designed to track &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2472.pdf">N2472&lt;/a>&lt;/span>, a proposal being actively considered by the ISO WG14 C Language Committee. We feel that these types are going to be extremely useful to many downstream users of Clang, and provides a language interface for LLVM's extremely powerful integer type class.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h3>Motivation&lt;/h3>LLVM-IR has the ability to represent integers with a bitwidth from 1 all the way to 16,777,215(&lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">(1&amp;lt;&amp;lt;24)-1&lt;/span>), however the C language is limited to just a few power-of-two sizes. Historically, these types have been sufficient for nearly all programming architectures, since power-of-two representation of integers is convenient and practical.&lt;br />&lt;br />Recently, Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) tooling, called High Level Synthesis Compilers (HLS), has become practical and powerful enough to use a general purpose programming language for their generation. These tools take C or C++ code and produce a transistor layout to be used by the FPGA. However, once programmers gained experience in these tools, it was discovered that the standard C integer types are incredibly wasteful for two main reasons.&lt;br />&lt;br />First, a vast majority of the time programmers are not using the full width of their integer types. It is rare for someone to use all 16, 32, or 64 bits of their integer representation. On traditional CPUs this isn't much of a problem as the hardware is already in place, so having bits never set comes at zero cost. On the other hand, on FPGAs logic gates are an incredibly valuable resource, and HLS compilers should not be required to waste bits on large power of two integers when they only need a small subset of that! While the optimizer passes are capable of removing some of these widths, a vast majority of this hardware needs to be emitted.&lt;br />&lt;br />Second, the C language requires that integers smaller than &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">int&lt;/span> are promoted to operations on the 'int' type. This further complicates hardware generation, as promotions to &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">int&lt;/span> are expensive and tend to stick with the operation for an entire statement at a time. These promotions typically have semantic meaning, so simply omitting them isn't possible without changing the meaning of the source code. Even worse, the proliferation of &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">auto&lt;/span> has resulted in user code results in the larger integer size being quite viral throughout a program.&lt;br />&lt;br />The result is massively larger FPGA/HLS programs than the programmer needed, and likely much larger than they intended. Worse, there was no way for the programmer express their intent in the cases where they do not need the full width of a standard integer type.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h3> Using the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">_ExtInt&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;Language Feature&lt;/h3>The patch as accepted and committed into LLVM solves most of the above problems by providing the &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">_ExtInt&lt;/span> class of types. These types translate directly into the corresponding LLVM-IR integer types. The &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">_ExtInt&lt;/span> keyword is a type-specifier (like &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">int&lt;/span>) that accepts a required integral constant expression parameter representing the number of bits to be used. More succinctly: &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">_ExtInt(7)&lt;/span> is a signed integer type using 7 bits. Because it is a type-specifier, it can also be combined with &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">signed&lt;/span> and &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">unsigned&lt;/span> to change the signedness (and overflow behavior!) of the values. So "&lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">unsigned _ExtInt(9) foo;"&lt;/span> declares a variable &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">foo&lt;/span> that is an unsigned integer type taking up 9 bits and represented as an &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">i9&lt;/span> in LLVM-IR.&lt;br />&lt;br />The &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">_ExtInt&lt;/span> types as implemented do not participate in any implicit conversions or integer promotions, so all math done on them happens at the appropriate bit-width. The WG14 paper proposes integer promotion to the largest of the types (that is, adding an &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">_ExtInt(5)&lt;/span> and an &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">_ExtInt(6)&lt;/span> would result in an &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">_ExtInt(6)&lt;/span>), however the implementation does not permit that and &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">_ExtInt(5) + _ExtInt(6)&lt;/span> would result in a compiler error. This was done so that in the event that WG14 changes the design of the paper, we will be able to implement it without breaking existing programs. In the meantime, this can be worked around with explicit casts: &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">(_ExtInt(6))AnExtInt5 + AnExtInt6&lt;/span> or &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">static_cast&amp;lt;ExtInt(6)&amp;gt;(AnExtInt5) + AnExtInt6.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />Additionally, for C++, clang supports making the bitwidth parameter a dependent expression, so that the following is legal:&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">template&amp;lt;size_t WidthA, size_t WidthB&amp;gt;&lt;br />&amp;nbsp; _ExtInt(WidthA + WidthB) lossless_mul(_ExtInt(WidthA) a, _ExtInt(WidthB) b) {&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;return static_cast&amp;lt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">_ExtInt(WidthA + WidthB)&amp;gt;(a)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * static_cast&amp;lt;&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">_ExtInt(WidthA + WidthB)&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&amp;gt;(b);&lt;br />}&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />We anticipate that this ability and these types will result in some extremely useful pieces of code, including novel uses of 256 bit, 512 bit, or larger integers, plus uses of 8 and 16 bit integers for those who can't afford promotions. For example, one can now trivially implement an extended integer type struct that does all operations provably losslessly, that is, adding two 6 bit values would result in a 7 bit value.&lt;br />&lt;br />In order to be consistent with the C Language, expressions that include a standard type will still follow integral promotion and conversion rules. All types smaller than &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">int&lt;/span> will be promoted, and the operation will then happen at the largest type.&amp;nbsp; This can be surprising in the case where you add a &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">short&lt;/span> and an &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">_ExtInt(15)&lt;/span>, where the result will be &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">int&lt;/span>. However, this ends up being the most consistent with the C language specification.&lt;br />&lt;br />Additionally, when it comes to conversions, these types 'lose' to the C standard types of the same size or greater. So, an &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">int&lt;/span> added to a &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">_ExtInt(32)&lt;/span> will result in an &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">int&lt;/span>. However, an &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">int&lt;/span> and a &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">_ExtInt(33)&lt;/span>will be the latter. This is necessary to preserve C integer semantics.&lt;br />&lt;h3>History&lt;/h3>As mentioned earlier, this feature has been a long time coming! In fact, this is likely the fourth implementation that was done along the way in order to get to this point. Additionally, this is far from over, we very much hope that upon acceptance of this by the WG14 Standards Committee that additional extensions and features will become available.&lt;br />&lt;br />I was approached to implement this feature in the Fall of 2017 by my company's FPGA group, which had the problems mentioned above. They had attempted a solution that used some clever parsing to make these look like templates, and implemented them extensively throughout the compiler. As I was concerned about the flexibility and usability of these types in the type and template system, we opted to implement these as a type-attribute under the controversially named Arbitrary Precision Int (spelled &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">__ap_int&lt;/span>). This spelling was heavily influenced by the vector-types implementations in GCC and Clang.&lt;br />&lt;br />We then were able to wrap a set of typedefs (or dependent &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">__ap_int&lt;/span> types) in a structure that provided exactly the C and C++ interface we wished to expose. As this was a then proprietary implementation, it was kept in our downstream implementation, where it received extensive testing and usage.&lt;br />&lt;br />Roughly a year later (and a little more than year ago from today!) I was authorized to contribute our implementation to the open source LLVM community! I decided to significantly refactor the implementation in order to better fit into the Clang type system, and uploaded it for &lt;a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D73967">review&lt;/a>.This (now third!) implementation of this feature was proposed via RFC and code review at the same time.&lt;br />&lt;br />While the usefulness was immediately acknowledged, it was rejected by the Clang code owner for two reasons: First the spelling was considered unpalatable, and Second it was a pure extension without standardization. This began the nearly year-long effort to come up with a standards proposal that would better define and describe the feature as well as come up with a spelling that was more in line with the standard language.&lt;br />&lt;br />Thanks to the invaluable feedback and input from Richard Smith, my coworkers Melanie Blower, Tommy Hoffner, and myself were able to propose the spelling _ExtInt for standardization. Additionally, the feature again re-implemented at the beginning of this year and eventually accepted and committed!&lt;br />&lt;br />The standardization paper (&lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2472.pdf">N2472&lt;/a>&lt;/span>) was presented at this Spring's WG14 ISO C Language Committee Meeting where it received near unanimous support. We expect to have an updated version of the paper with wording ready for the next WG14 meeting, where we hope it will receive sufficient support to be accepted into the language.&lt;br />&lt;h3>Future Extensions&lt;/h3>While the feautre as committed in Clang is incredibly useful, it can be taken further. There are a handful of future extensions that we wish to implement once guidance from WG14 has been given on their direction and implementation.&lt;br />&lt;br />First, we believe the special integer promotion/conversion rules, which omit automatic promotion to&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">int&lt;/span> and instead provide operations at the largest type are both incredibly useful and powerful. While we have received positive encouragement from WG14, we hope that the wording paper we provide will both clarify the mechanism and definition in a way that supports all common uses.&lt;br />&lt;br />Secondly, we would like to choose a printf/scanf specifier that permits specifying the type for the C language. This was the topic of the WG14 discussion, and also received strong encouragement. We intend to come up with a good representation, then implement this in major implementations.&lt;br />&lt;br />Finally, numerous people have suggested implementing a way of spelling literals of this type. This is important for two reasons: First, it allows using literals without casts in expressions in a way that doesn't run afoul of promotion rules. Second, it provides a way of spelling integer literals larger than &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;span class="t-lines">UINTMAX_MAX&lt;/span>&lt;/span>, which can be useful for initializing the larger versions of these types. While the spelling is undecided, we intend something like: &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">1234X&lt;/span> would result in an integer literal with the value &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">1234&lt;/span> represented in an &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">_ExtInt(11)&lt;/span>, which is the smallest type capable of storing this value. &lt;br />&lt;br />However, without the integer promotion/conversion rules above, this feature isn't nearly as useful. Additionally, we'd like to be consistent with whatever the C language committee chooses. As soon as we receive positive guidance on the spelling and syntax of this type, we look forward to providing an implementation.&lt;br />&lt;h3>Conclusion&lt;/h3>In closing, we encourage you to try using this and provide feedback to both myself, my proposal co-authors, and the C committee itself! We feel this is a really useful feature and would love to get as much user experience as possible. Feel free to contact myself and my co-authors with any questions or concerns!&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>-&lt;/b>&lt;a href="mailto:erich.keane@intel.com" rel="nofollow">Erich Keane&lt;/a>, Intel Corporation</description></item><item><title>Deterministic builds with clang and lld</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2019/11/deterministic-builds-with-clang-and-lld.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2019 12:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2019/11/deterministic-builds-with-clang-and-lld.html</guid><description>
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Deterministic builds can lower continuous integration costs and give you more confidence in your build and test process. This post outlines what it means for a build to be deterministic, the advantages of deterministic builds, and how to achieve them using LLVM tools.&lt;br />&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">What is a deterministic build, and its advantages&lt;/h3>A build is called &lt;i>deterministic &lt;/i>or &lt;i>reproducible &lt;/i>if running it twice produces exactly the same build outputs.&lt;br />&lt;br />There are several degrees of build determinism that are increasingly useful but increasingly difficult to achieve:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;ol style="text-align: left;">&lt;li>&lt;i>Basic &lt;/i>determinism: Doing a full build of the same source code in the same directory on the same machine produces exactly the same output every time, in the sense that a content hash of the final build artifacts and of all intermediate files does not change.&lt;/li>&lt;ul>&lt;li>Once you have this, if all your builders are configured the same way (OS version, toolchain, build path, checkout path, …), they can share build artifacts, for example by using distcc.&lt;/li>&lt;li>This also allows local caching of test suite results keyed by a hash of test binary and test input files.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Illustrative example: &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">./build src out ; mv out out.old ; ./build src out ; diff -r out out.old&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;li>&lt;i>Incremental &lt;/i>basic determinism: Like basic determinism, but the output binaries also don’t change in partial rebuilds. In build systems that track file modification times to decide when to rebuild, this means for example that updating the modification time on a C++ source file (without doing any actual changes) and rebuilding will produce the same output as a full build.&lt;/li>&lt;ul>&lt;li>This allows having build bots that don’t do full builds each time, while still allowing caching of compile artifacts and test results.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Illustrative example: &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">./build src out ; cp -r out out.old ; touch src/foo.c ; ./build src out ; diff -r out out.old&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;li>&lt;i>Local &lt;/i>determinism: Like incremental basic determinism, but builds are also independent of the name of the build directory. Builds of the same source code on the same machine produce exactly the same output every time, independent of the location of the source checkout directory or the build directory.&lt;/li>&lt;ul>&lt;li>This allows machines to have several build directories at different locations but still share compile and test caches.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Illustrative example:&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;"> cp -r src src2 ; ./build src out ; ./build src2 out2 ; diff -r out out2&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;li>&lt;i>Universal &lt;/i>determinism: Like 3, but builds are also independent of the machine the build runs on. Everybody that checks out the project at a given revision into any directory and builds it following the build instructions ends up with exactly the same bits in the build output.&lt;/li>&lt;ul>&lt;li>Since exact local OS and locally installed packages no longer matter, this allows devs to share compile and test caches with bots, without having to use difficult-to-setup containers.&lt;/li>&lt;li>It also allows easy verification of builds done by others to make sure output binaries haven’t been tampered with.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Illustrative example: &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">./build src out ; ssh remote ./build src out &amp;amp;&amp;amp; scp remote:out out2 ; diff -r out out2&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;/ol>&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">Plan of attack&lt;/h3>To make sure that a deterministic build stays deterministic, you should set up a builder that verifies that your build is deterministic. Even if your build isn’t deterministic yet, you can set up a bot that verifies that some parts of your build are deterministic and then expand the checks over time.&lt;br />&lt;br />For example, you could have a bot that does a full build in a fixed build directory, then moves the build artifacts out of the way, and does another full build, and once your compiles have basic determinism, add a step that checks that object files between the two builds directories are the same. You could even add incremental checking for specific subdirectories or build targets while you work towards full basic determinism.&lt;br />&lt;br />Once your links are deterministic, check that binaries are identical as well. Once all your build steps are deterministic, compare all files in the two build directories.&lt;br />&lt;br />Once your build has incremental determinism, do an incremental build for the first build and a full build for the second build. Once your build has local determinism, do the two builds at different build paths.&lt;br />&lt;h4>Getting to basic determinism&lt;/h4>Basic determinism needs tools (compiler, linker, etc) that are deterministic. Tools internally must not output things in hash table order, multi-threaded programs must not write output in the order threads finish, etc. All of LLVM’s tools have deterministic outputs when run with the right flags but not necessarily by default.&lt;br />&lt;br />The C standard defines the predefined macros &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">__TIME__&lt;/span> and &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">__DATE__&lt;/span> that expand to the time a source file is compiled. Several compilers, including clang, also define the non-standard &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">__TIMESTAMP__&lt;/span>. This is inherently nondeterministic. You should not use these macros, and you can use &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-Wdate-time&lt;/span> to make the compiler emit a warning when they are used.&lt;br />&lt;br />If they are used in third-party code you don’t control, you can use&lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc;"> &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-Wno-builtin-macro-redefined -D__DATE__= -D__TIME__= -D__TIMESTAMP__=&lt;/span>&lt;/span> to make them expand to nothing.&lt;br />&lt;br />When targeting Windows, clang and clang-cl by default also embed the current time in a timestamp field in the output .obj file, because Microsoft’s link.exe in &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">/incremental&lt;/span> mode silently mislinks files if that field isn’t set correctly. If you don’t use link.exe’s &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">/incremental&lt;/span> flag, or if you link with lld-link, you should pass &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc; font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">/Brepro&lt;/span> to clang-cl to make it not write the current timestamp into its output.&lt;br />&lt;br />Both link.exe and lld-link also write the current timestamp into output .dll or .exe files. To make them instead write a hash of the binary into this field, you can pass &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">/Brepro&lt;/span> to the linker as well. However, some tools, such as Windows 7’s app compatibility database, try to interpret that field as an actual timestamp and can get confused if it’s set to a hash of the binary. For this case, lld-link also offers a &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc; font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">/timestamp:&lt;/span> flag that you can give an explicit timestamp that’s written into the output. You could use this to for example write the time of the commit the code is built at instead of the current time to make it deterministic. (But see the footnote on embedding commit hashes below.)&lt;br />&lt;br />Visual Studio’s assemblers ml.exe and ml64.exe also insist on writing the current time into their output. In situations like this, where you can’t easily fix the tool to write the right output in the first place, you need to write wrappers that fix up the file after the fact. As an example, &lt;a href="https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/build/toolchain/win/ml.py" style="background-color: #fff2cc;">ml.py&lt;/a> is the wrapper the Chromium project uses to make ml’s output deterministic.&lt;br />&lt;br />macOS’s libtool and ld64 also insist on writing timestamps into their outputs. You can set the environment variable &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc; font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">ZERO_AR_DATE&lt;/span> to 1 in a wrapper to make their output deterministic, but that confuses lldb of older Xcode versions.&lt;br />&lt;br />Gcc sometimes uses random numbers in certain symbol mangling situations. Clang does not do this, so there’s no need to pass &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-frandom-seed&lt;/span> to clang.&lt;br />&lt;br />It’s a good idea to make your build independent of environment variables as much as possible, so that accidental local changes in the environment don’t affect the build output. You should pass &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc; font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">/X&lt;/span> to clang-cl to make it ignore &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">%INCLUDE%&lt;/span> and explicitly pass system include directories via the &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc; font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-imsvc&lt;/span> switch instead. Likewise, very new lld-link versions (LLVM 10 and newer, at the time of this writing still unreleased) understand the flag &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc;">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">/lldignoreenv&lt;/span>&lt;/span> flag, which makes lld-link ignore the &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">%LIB%&lt;/span> environment variable; explicitly pass system library directories via &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc;">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">/libpath:&lt;/span>&lt;/span>.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Footnote on embedding git hashes into the binary&lt;/b>&lt;br />It might be tempting to embed the git commit hash or svn revision that a binary was built at into the binary’s --version output, or use the revision as a cache key to invalidate on-disk caches when the version changes.&lt;br />&lt;br />This doesn’t affect your build’s determinism, but it does affect the hit rate if you’re using deterministic builds to cache test run results. If your binary embeds the current commit, it is guaranteed to change on every single commit, and you won’t be able to cache test results across commits. Even commits that just fix typos in comments, add non-code documentation, or that only affect code used by some but not all of your binaries will change every binary.&lt;br />&lt;br />For cache invalidation, consider using something finer-grained, such as only the latest commit of the directory containing the cache handling code, or the hash of all source files containing the cache handling code.&lt;br />&lt;br />For --version output, if your build is fully deterministic, the hash of the binary itself (and its dynamic library dependencies) can serve as a stable version identifier. You can keep a map of binary hash to all commit hashes that produce that binary somewhere.&lt;br />&lt;br />Windows only: For the same reason, just using the timestamp of the latest commit as a /timestamp: might not be the best option. Rounding the timestamp of the latest commit to 6h (or similar) granularity is a possible approach for not having the timestamp change the binary on every commit, while still keeping the timestamp close to reality. For production builds, the symbol server key for binaries is a (executable size, timestamp) pair, so here having fairly granular timestamps is important to not map binaries from consecutive commits to the same symbol server key. Depending on how often you push production binaries to your symbol servers, you might want to use the timestamp of the latest commit as &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">/timestamp:&lt;/span> for official builds, or you might want to round to finer granularity than you do on dev builds.&lt;br />&lt;h4 style="text-align: left;">Getting to incremental determinism&lt;/h4>Having deterministic incremental builds mostly requires having correct incremental builds, meaning that if a file is changed and the build reruns, everything that uses this file needs to be rebuilt.&lt;br />&lt;br />This is very build system dependent, so this post can’t say much about it.&lt;br />&lt;br />In general, every build step needs to correctly declare all the inputs it depends on.&lt;br />&lt;br />Some tools, such as Visual Studio’s link.exe in &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">/incremental&lt;/span> mode, by design write a different output every time. Don’t use inherently incrementally non-deterministic tools like that if you care about build determinism.&lt;br />&lt;br />The build should not depend on environment variables, since build systems usually don’t model dependencies on environment variables.&lt;br />&lt;h4 style="text-align: left;">Getting to local determinism&lt;/h4>Making build outputs independent of the names of the checkout or build directory means that build outputs must not contain absolute paths, or relative paths that contain the name of either directory.&lt;br />&lt;br />A possible way to arrange for that is to put all build directories into the checkout directory. For example, if your code is at path/to/src, then you could have “out” in your .gitignore and build directories at path/to/src/out/debug, path/to/src/out/release, and so on. The relative path from each build artifact to the source is with “../../” followed by the path of the source file in the source directory, which is identical for each build directory.&lt;br />&lt;br />The C standard defines the predefined macro &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">__FILE__&lt;/span> that expands to the name of the current source file. Clang expands this to an absolute path if it is invoked with an absolute path (`clang -c /absolute/path/to/my/file.cc`), and to a relative path if it is invoked with a relative path (`clang ../../path/to/my/file.cc`). To make your build locally deterministic, &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc;">pass relative paths to your .cc files to clang&lt;/span>.&lt;br />&lt;br />By default, clang will internally use absolute paths to refer to compiler-internal headers. Pass &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc;">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-no-canonical-prefixes&lt;/span>&lt;/span> to make clang use relative paths for these internal files.&lt;br />&lt;br />Passing relative paths to clang makes clang expand &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">__FILE__&lt;/span> to a relative path, but paths in debug information are still absolute by default. Pass &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc; font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-fdebug-compilation-dir .&lt;/span> to make paths in debug information relative to the build directory. (Before LLVM 9, this is an internal clang flag that must be used as `&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-Xclang -fdebug-compilation-dir -Xclang .&lt;/span>`) When using clang’s integrated assembler (the default), &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc; font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-Wa,-fdebug-compilation-dir,.&lt;/span> will do the same for object files created from assembly input. (For ml.exe / ml64.exe, see the script linked to from the “Basic determinism” section above.)&lt;br />&lt;br />Using this means that debuggers won’t automatically find the source code belonging to your binary. At the moment, there’s no way to tell debuggers to resolve relative paths relative to the location of the binary (&lt;a href="http://dwarfstd.org/ShowIssue.php?issue=171130.2">DWARF proposal&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://gnutoolchain-gerrit.osci.io/r/c/binutils-gdb/+/402">gdb patch&lt;/a>). See the end of this section for how to configure common debuggers to work correctly.&lt;br />&lt;br />There are a few flags that try to make compilers produce relative paths in outputs even if the filename passed to the compiler is absolute (&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-fdebug-prefix-map&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-ffile-prefix-map&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-fmacro-prefix-map&lt;/span>). &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc;">Do not use these flags&lt;/span>.&lt;br />&lt;ul style="text-align: left;">&lt;li>They work by adding lhs=rhs replacement patterns, and the lhs must be an absolute path to remove the absolute path from the output. That means that while they make the compile output path-independent, they make the compile command itself path-dependent, which hinders distributed compile caching. With &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-grecord-gcc-switches&lt;/span> or &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-frecord-gcc-switches&lt;/span> the compile command is embedded in debug info or even the object file itself, so in that case the flags even break local determinism. (Both &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-grecord-gcc-switches&lt;/span> and &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-frecord-gcc-switches&lt;/span> default to false in clang.)&lt;/li>&lt;li>They don’t affect the paths in dwo files when using fission; passing relative paths to the compiler is the only way to make these paths relative.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>On Windows, it’s very unusual to have PDBs with relative paths. You can pass &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc; font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">/pdbsourcepath:X:\fake\prefix&lt;/span> to lld-link to make it resolve all relative paths in object files against a fixed absolute path to make sure your final PDBs contain absolute paths. Since the absolute path is against a fixed prefix, this doesn’t impair determinism. With this, both binaries and PDBs created by clang-cl and lld-link will be fully deterministic and build path independent.&lt;br />&lt;br />Also on Windows, the linker by default puts the absolute path the to the generated PDB file in the output binary. Pass &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc; font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">/pdbaltpath:%_PDB%&lt;/span> when you pass &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">/debug&lt;/span> to make the linker write a relative path to the generated PDB file instead. If you have custom build steps that extract PDB names from binaries, you have to make sure these scripts work with relative paths. Microsoft’s tools (debuggers, ETW) work fine with this set in most situations, and you can add a symbol search path in the cases where they don’t (when the binaries are copied before being run).&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Getting debuggers to work well with locally deterministic builds&lt;/b>&lt;br />At the moment, no debugger offers an option to resolve relative paths in debug info against the directory the debugged binary is in.&lt;br />&lt;br />Some debuggers (gdb, lldb) do try to resolve relative paths against the cwd, so a simple way to make debugging work is to cd into your build directory before debugging.&lt;br />&lt;br />If you don’t want to require devs to cd into the build directory for debugging to work, you have to do debugger-specific configuration tweaks.&lt;br />&lt;br />To make sure devs don’t miss this, you could have your custom init script set an env var and query if it’s set early during your test binary startup, and exit with a message like “Add `source /path/to/your/project/gdbinit` to your ~/.gdbinit” if the environment variable isn’t set.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;i>gdb&lt;/i>&lt;br />`dir path/to/build/dir` tells gdb what directory to resolve relative paths against.&lt;br />&lt;br />`show debug-file-directory` prints the list of directories gdb looks in for dwo files. Query that, append `:path/to/build/dir`, and call `set debug-file-directory` to add your build dir to that search path.&lt;br />&lt;br />For an example, see &lt;a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/tools/gdb/gdbinit#78">Chromium’s gdbinit&lt;/a> (which also does a few other unrelated things).&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;i>lldb&lt;/i>&lt;br />`settings set target.source-map ../.. /absolute/path/to/build/dir` can map the “../..” prefix that all .cc files will refer to when using the setup described above with an absolute path. This requires Xcode 10.3 or newer; the lldb shipping with Xcode 10.1 has problems with this setup.&lt;br />&lt;br />For an example, see &lt;a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/tools/lldb/lldbinit.py">Chromium’s lldbinit&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;i>Visual Studio’s debugger and windbg&lt;/i>&lt;br />If you use the setup described above,&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">/PDBSourcePath:X:\fake\prefix&lt;/span> will combine with the “..\..\my\file.cc” relative paths to make your code appear at “X:\my\file.cc”. To make Windows debuggers find them, you have two options:&lt;br />&lt;ol style="text-align: left;">&lt;li>Run `subst X: C:\src\real\root` in cmd.exe before launching the debuggers to create a virtual drive that maps X: to the actual source location. Both windbg and Visual Studio will load code over X: this way.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Add “C:\src\real\root” to each debugger’s source search path.&lt;/li>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/source-window#source-path">Windbg&lt;/a>: Run `.srcpath+ C:\src\real\root`. You can also set this via the _NT_SOURCE_PATH&amp;nbsp; environment variable, or via&amp;nbsp; File-&amp;gt;Source File Path (Ctrl+P). Or pass `-srcpath C:\src\real\root` when launching windbg from the command line.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Visual Studio: The IDE has a &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debug-source-files-common-properties-solution-property-pages-dialog-box?view=vs-2019">“Debug Source Files” property&lt;/a>. Add C:\src\real\root to “Directories containing source code” to Project-&amp;gt;Properties (Alt+F7)-&amp;gt;Common Properties-&amp;gt;Debug Source Files-&amp;gt;Directories containing source code.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;/ol>Alternatively, you could pass the absolute path to the actual build directory to &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">/PDBSourcePath:&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;instead of something like “X:\fake\prefix”. That way, all PDBs have “correct” absolute paths in them, while your compile steps are still path-independent and can share a cache across machines. However, since executables contain a reference to the PDB hash, none of your binaries will be path-independent. This setup doesn’t require any debugger configuration, but it doesn’t allow your builds to be locally deterministic.&lt;br />&lt;h4 style="text-align: left;">Getting to universal determinism&lt;/h4>By now, your build output is deterministic as long as everyone uses the same compiler, and linker binaries, and as long as everyone uses the version of the SDK and system libraries.&lt;br />&lt;br />Making your build independent of that requires making sure that everyone automatically uses the same compiler, linker, and SDK.&lt;br />&lt;br />This might seem like a lot of work, but in addition to build determinism this work also gives you cross builds (where you can e.g. build the Linux version of your product on a Windows host).&lt;br />&lt;br />It also versions the compiler, linker, and SDK used within your code, which means you will be able to update all your bots and devs to new versions automatically (and if an update causes issues, it’s easy to revert it).&lt;br />&lt;br />You need to store the currently-used compiler, linker, and SDK versions in a file in your source control repository, and from some kind of hook that runs after pulling the newest version of the source, download compiler, linker, and SDK of the right version from some kind of cloud storage service.&lt;br />&lt;br />You then need to modify your build files to use &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc; font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">--sysroot&lt;/span> (Linux), &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc; font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-isysroot&lt;/span> (macOS), &lt;span style="background-color: #fff2cc;">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">-imsvc&lt;/span>&lt;/span> (Windows) to use these hermetic SDKs for builds. They need to be somewhere below your source root to not regress build directory name invariance.&lt;br />&lt;br />You also want to make sure your build doesn’t depend on environment variables, as already mentioned in the “Getting to incremental determinism”, since environments between different machines can be very different and difficult to control.&lt;br />&lt;br />Build steps shouldn’t embed the hostname of the current machine or the logged-in user name in the build output, or similar.&lt;br />&lt;h4 style="text-align: left;">Summary&lt;/h4>This post explained what deterministic builds are, how build determinism spans a spectrum (local, fixed-build-dir-path-only to fully host-OS-independent) instead of just being binary, and how you can use LLVM’s tools to make your build deterministic. It also touched on techniques you can use to make your test caches more effective.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;i>Thanks to Elly Fong-Jones for helping edit and structure this post, and to Adrian McCarthy, Bob Haarman, Bruce Dawson, Dirk Pranke, Fumitoshi Ukai, Hans Wennborg, Kai Naschinski, Reid Kleckner, Rui Ueyama, and Takuto Ikuta for reading drafts and suggesting improvements.&lt;/i>&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Closing the gap: cross-language LTO between Rust and C/C++</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2019/09/closing-gap-cross-language-lto-between.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2019 05:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2019/09/closing-gap-cross-language-lto-between.html</guid><description>
Link time optimization (LTO) is LLVM's way of implementing whole-program optimization. &lt;i>Cross-language&lt;/i> LTO is a new feature in the Rust compiler that enables LLVM's link time optimization to be performed across a mixed C/C++/Rust codebase. It is also a feature that beautifully combines two respective strengths of the Rust programming language and the LLVM compiler platform:&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li style="text-indent: 0;">Rust, with its lack of a language runtime and its low-level reach, has an almost unique ability to seamlessly integrate with an existing C/C++ codebase, and&lt;/li>&lt;li style="text-indent: 0;">LLVM, as a language agnostic foundation, provides a common ground where the source language a particular piece of code was written in does not matter anymore.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>So, what does cross-language LTO do? There are two answers to that:&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li style="text-indent: 0;">From a technical perspective it allows for codebases to be optimized without regard for implementation language boundaries, making it possible for important optimizations, such as function inlining, to be performed across individual compilation units even if, for example, one of the compilation units is written in Rust while the other is written in C++.&lt;/li>&lt;li style="text-indent: 0;">From a psychological perspective, which arguably is just as important, it helps to alleviate the nagging feeling of inefficiency that many performance conscious developers might have when working on a piece of software that jumps back and forth a lot between functions implemented in different source languages.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Because Firefox is a large, performance sensitive codebase with substantial parts written in Rust, cross-language LTO has been a long-time favorite wish list item among Firefox developers. As a consequence, we at Mozilla's Low Level Tools team took it upon ourselves to implement it in the Rust compiler.&lt;br />&lt;br />To explain how cross-language LTO works it is useful to take a step back and review how traditional compilation and "regular" link time optimization work in the LLVM world.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h3>Background - A bird's eye view of the LLVM compilation pipeline&lt;/h3>Clang and the Rust compiler both follow a similar compilation workflow which, to some degree, is prescribed by LLVM:&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li style="text-indent: 0;">The compiler front-end generates an LLVM bitcode module (&lt;code>.bc&lt;/code>) for each compilation unit. In C and C++ each source file will result in a single compilation unit. In Rust each crate is translated into at least one compilation unit.&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;code style="background-color: #e7e7e7; display: block;">&lt;br /> .c --clang--&amp;gt; .bc&lt;br />&lt;br /> .c --clang--&amp;gt; .bc&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br /> .rs --+&lt;br /> |&lt;br /> .rs --+--rustc--&amp;gt; .bc&lt;br /> |&lt;br /> .rs --+&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/li>&lt;li style="text-indent: 0;">In the next step, LLVM's optimization pipeline will optimize each LLVM module in isolation: &lt;pre>&lt;code style="background-color: #e7e7e7; display: block;">&lt;br /> .c --clang--&amp;gt; .bc --LLVM--&amp;gt; .bc (opt)&lt;br />&lt;br /> .c --clang--&amp;gt; .bc --LLVM--&amp;gt; .bc (opt)&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br /> .rs --+&lt;br /> |&lt;br /> .rs --+--rustc--&amp;gt; .bc --LLVM--&amp;gt; .bc (opt)&lt;br /> |&lt;br /> .rs --+&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/li>&lt;li style="text-indent: 0;">LLVM then lowers each module into machine code so that we get one object file per module: &lt;pre>&lt;code style="background-color: #e7e7e7; display: block;">&lt;br /> .c --clang--&amp;gt; .bc --LLVM--&amp;gt; .bc (opt) --LLVM--&amp;gt; .o&lt;br />&lt;br /> .c --clang--&amp;gt; .bc --LLVM--&amp;gt; .bc (opt) --LLVM--&amp;gt; .o&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br /> .rs --+&lt;br /> |&lt;br /> .rs --+--rustc--&amp;gt; .bc --LLVM--&amp;gt; .bc (opt) --LLVM--&amp;gt; .o&lt;br /> |&lt;br /> .rs --+&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/li>&lt;li style="text-indent: 0;">Finally, the linker will take the set of object files and link them together into a binary: &lt;pre>&lt;code style="background-color: #e7e7e7; display: block;">&lt;br /> .c --clang--&amp;gt; .bc --LLVM--&amp;gt; .bc (opt) --LLVM--&amp;gt; .o ------+&lt;br /> |&lt;br /> .c --clang--&amp;gt; .bc --LLVM--&amp;gt; .bc (opt) --LLVM--&amp;gt; .o ------+&lt;br /> |&lt;br /> +--ld--&amp;gt; bin&lt;br /> .rs --+ |&lt;br /> | |&lt;br /> .rs --+--rustc--&amp;gt; .bc --LLVM--&amp;gt; .bc (opt) --LLVM--&amp;gt; .o --+&lt;br /> |&lt;br /> .rs --+&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>This is the regular compilation workflow if no kind of LTO is involved. As you can see, each compilation unit is optimized in isolation. The optimizer does not know the definition of functions inside of other compilation units and thus cannot inline them or make other kinds of decisions based on what they actually do. To enable inlining and optimizations to happen across compilation unit boundaries, LLVM supports link time optimization.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h3>Link time optimization in LLVM&lt;/h3>The basic principle behind LTO is that some of LLVM's optimization passes are pushed back to the linking stage. Why the linking stage? Because that is the point in the pipeline where the entire program (i.e. the whole set of compilation units) is available at once and thus optimizations across compilation unit boundaries become possible. Performing LLVM work at the linking stage is facilitated via a &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html">plugin&lt;/a> to the linker.&lt;br />&lt;br />Here is how LTO is concretely implemented:&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li style="text-indent: 0;">the compiler translates each compilation unit into LLVM bitcode (i.e. it skips lowering to machine code),&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>&lt;li style="text-indent: 0;">the linker, via the LLVM linker plugin, knows how to read LLVM bitcode modules like regular object files, and&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>&lt;li style="text-indent: 0;">the linker, again via the LLVM linker plugin, merges all bitcode modules it encounters and then runs LLVM optimization passes before doing the actual linking.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>With these capabilities in place a new compilation workflow with LTO enabled for C++ code looks like this: &lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;code style="background-color: #e7e7e7; display: block;">&lt;br /> .c --clang--&amp;gt; .bc --LLVM--&amp;gt; .bc (opt) ------------------+ - - +&lt;br /> | |&lt;br /> .c --clang--&amp;gt; .bc --LLVM--&amp;gt; .bc (opt) ------------------+ - - +&lt;br /> | |&lt;br /> +-ld+LLVM--&amp;gt; bin&lt;br /> .rs --+ |&lt;br /> | |&lt;br /> .rs --+--rustc--&amp;gt; .bc --LLVM--&amp;gt; .bc (opt) --LLVM--&amp;gt; .o -+&lt;br /> |&lt;br /> .rs --+&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>As you can see our Rust code is still compiled to a regular object file. Therefore, the Rust code is opaque to the optimization taking place at link time. Yet, looking at the diagram it seems like that shouldn't be too hard to change, right?&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h3>Cross-language link time optimization&lt;/h3>Implementing cross-language LTO is conceptually simple because the feature is built on the shoulders of giants. Since the Rust compiler uses LLVM all the important building blocks are readily available. The final diagram looks very much as you would expect, with &lt;code>rustc&lt;/code> emitting optimized LLVM bitcode and the LLVM linker plugin incorporating that into the LTO process with the rest of the modules: &lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;code style="background-color: #e7e7e7; display: block;">&lt;br /> .c --clang--&amp;gt; .bc --LLVM--&amp;gt; .bc (opt) ---------+&lt;br /> |&lt;br /> .c --clang--&amp;gt; .bc --LLVM--&amp;gt; .bc (opt) ---------+&lt;br /> |&lt;br /> +-ld+LLVM--&amp;gt; bin&lt;br /> .rs --+ |&lt;br /> | |&lt;br /> .rs --+--rustc--&amp;gt; .bc --LLVM--&amp;gt; .bc (opt) -----+&lt;br /> |&lt;br /> .rs --+&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>Nonetheless, achieving a production-ready implementation still turned out to be a significant time investment. After figuring out how everything fits together, the main challenge was to get the Rust compiler to produce LLVM bitcode that was compatible with both the bitcode that Clang produces and with what the linker plugin would accept. Some of the issues we ran into where:&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li style="text-indent: 0;">The Rust compiler and Clang are both based on LLVM but they might be using different versions of LLVM. This was further complicated by the fact that Rust's LLVM version often does not match a specific LLVM release, but can be an arbitrary revision from LLVM's repository. We learned that all LLVM versions involved really have to be a close match in order for things to work out. The Rust compiler's documentation now offers a &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/linker-plugin-lto.html#toolchain-compatibility">compatibility table&lt;/a> for the various versions of Rust and Clang.&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>&lt;li style="text-indent: 0;">The Rust compiler by default performs a special form of LTO, called &lt;a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThinLTO.html">ThinLTO&lt;/a>, on all compilation units of the same crate before passing them on to the linker. We quickly learned, however, that the LLVM linker plugin crashes with a segmentation fault when trying to perform another round of ThinLTO on a module that had already gone through the process. No problem, we thought and instructed the Rust compiler to disable its own ThinLTO pass when compiling for the cross-language case and indeed everything was fine -- until the segmentation faults mysteriously returned a few weeks later even though ThinLTO was still disabled.&lt;br />&lt;br />We noticed that the problem only occurred in a specific, presumably innocent setting: again two passes of LTO needed to happen, this time the first was a &lt;a href="https://www.llvm.org/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.html">regular LTO&lt;/a> pass within &lt;code>rustc&lt;/code> and the output of that would then be fed into ThinLTO within the linker plugin. This setup, although computationally expensive, was desirable because it produced faster code and allowed for better dead-code elimination on the Rust side. And in theory it should have worked just fine. Yet somehow &lt;code>rustc&lt;/code> produced symbol names that had apparently gone through ThinLTO's mangling even though we checked time and again that ThinLTO was disabled for Rust. We were beginning to seriously question our understanding of LLVM's inner workings as the problem persisted while we slowly ran out of ideas on how to debug this further.&lt;br />&lt;br />You can picture the proverbial lightbulb appearing over our heads when we figured out that Rust's pre-compiled standard library would still have ThinLTO enabled, no matter the compiler settings we were using for our tests. The standard library, including its LLVM bitcode representation, is compiled as part of Rust's binary distribution so it is always compiled with the settings from Rust's build servers. Our local full LTO pass within &lt;code>rustc&lt;/code> would then pull this troublesome bitcode into the output module which in turn would make the linker plugin crash again. Since then ThinLTO is &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55264">turned off&lt;/a> for &lt;code>libstd&lt;/code> by default.&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>&lt;li style="text-indent: 0;">After the above fixes, we succeeded in compiling the entirety of Firefox with cross-language LTO enabled. Unfortunately, we discovered that no actual cross-language optimizations were happening. Both Clang and &lt;code>rustc&lt;/code> were producing LLVM bitcode and LLD produced functioning Firefox binaries, but when looking at the machine code, not even trivial functions were being inlined across language boundaries. After days of debugging (and unfortunately without being aware of &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/Remarks.html">LLVM's optimization remarks&lt;/a> at the time) it turned out that Clang was emitting a &lt;code>target-cpu&lt;/code> attribute on all functions while &lt;code>rustc&lt;/code> didn't, which made LLVM reject inlining opportunities.&lt;br />&lt;br />In order to prevent the feature from silently regressing for similar reasons in the future we put quite a bit of effort into extending the Rust compiler's testing framework and CI. It is now able to compile and run a compatible version of Clang and uses that to perform end-to-end tests of cross-language LTO, making sure that small functions will indeed get inlined across language boundaries.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>This list could still go on for a while, with each additional target platform holding new surprises to be dealt with. We had to progress carefully by putting in regression tests at every step in order to keep the many moving parts in check. At this point, however, we feel confident in the underlying implementation, with Firefox providing a large, complex, multi-platform test case where things have been working well for several months now.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h3>Using cross-language LTO: a minimal example&lt;/h3>The exact build tool invocations differ depending on whether it is &lt;code>rustc&lt;/code> or Clang performing the final linking step, and whether Rust code is compiled via Cargo or via &lt;code>rustc&lt;/code> directly. Rust's &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/linker-plugin-lto.html">compiler documentation&lt;/a> describes the various cases. The simplest of them, where &lt;code>rustc&lt;/code> directly produces a static library and Clang does the linking, looks as follows: &lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;code style="background-color: #e7e7e7; display: block;">&lt;br /> # Compile the Rust static library, called "xyz"&lt;br /> rustc --crate-type=staticlib -O -C linker-plugin-lto -o libxyz.a lib.rs&lt;br />&lt;br /> # Compile the C code with "-flto"&lt;br /> clang -flto -c -O2 main.c&lt;br />&lt;br /> # Link everything&lt;br /> clang -flto -O2 main.o -L . -lxyz&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>The &lt;code>-C linker-plugin-lto&lt;/code> option instructs the Rust compiler to emit LLVM bitcode which then can be used for both "full" and "thin" LTO. Getting things set up for the first time can be quite cumbersome because, as already mentioned, all compilers and the linker involved must be compatible versions. In theory, most major linkers will work; in practice LLD seems to be the most reliable one on Linux, with Gold in second place and the BFD linker needing to be at least version 2.32. On Windows and macOS the only linkers properly tested are LLD and &lt;code>ld64&lt;/code> respectively. For &lt;code>ld64&lt;/code> Firefox uses a patched version because the LLVM bitcode that &lt;code>rustc&lt;/code> produces likes to trigger a &lt;a href="https://github.com/froydnj/ld64-aliases-bug">pre-existing issue&lt;/a> this linker has with ThinLTO.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h3>Conclusion&lt;/h3>Cross-language LTO has been enabled for Firefox release builds on Windows, macOS, and Linux for several months at this point and we at Mozilla's Low Level Tools team are pleased with how it turned out. While we still &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/60059">need to work&lt;/a> on making the initial setup of the feature easier, it already enabled removing duplicated logic from Rust components in Firefox because now code can simply call into the equivalent C++ implementation and rely on those calls to be inlined. Having cross-language LTO in place and continuously tested will definitely lower the psychological bar for implementing new components in Rust, even if they are tightly integrated with existing C++ code.&lt;br />&lt;br />Cross-language LTO is available in the Rust compiler since version 1.34 and works together with Clang 8. Feel free to give it a try and report any problems in the Rust &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues">bug tracker&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h3>Acknowledgments&lt;/h3>I'd like to thank my Low Level Tools team colleagues David Major, Eric Rahm, and Nathan Froyd for their invaluable help and encouragement, and I'd like to thank Alex Crichton for his tireless reviews on the Rust side.</description></item><item><title>Announcing the program for the 2019 LLVM Developers' Meeting - Bay Area</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2019/09/announcing-program-for-2019-llvm.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2019 07:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2019/09/announcing-program-for-2019-llvm.html</guid><description>

If you manage any continuous integration or other systems that need read-only access to the LLVM source code, you should begin pulling from the official &lt;/span>&lt;a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project" style="text-decoration: none;">&lt;span style="-webkit-text-decoration-skip: none;

One purpose of this blog post is to refresh everyone's memory on where we are on the topic of numerics to restart the discussion.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

-webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;">&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;">In the last year or two there has been a push to allow fine-grained decisions on which optimizations are legitimate for any given piece of IR.&amp;nbsp; In earlier days there were two main modes of operation: fast-math and precise-math.&amp;nbsp; When operating under the rules of precise-math, defined by IEEE-754, a significant number of potential optimizations on sequences of arithmetic instructions are not allowed because they could lead to violations of the standard. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; min-height: 13px;">&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;">&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;">For example:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; min-height: 13px;">&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;">&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;">The Reassociation optimization pass is generally not allowed under precise code generation as it can change the order of operations altering the creation of NaN and Inf values propagated at the expression level as well as altering precision. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; min-height: 13px;">&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;">&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;">Precise code generation is often overly restrictive, so an alternative fast-math mode is commonly used where all possible optimizations are allowed, acknowledging that this impacts the precision of results and possibly IEEE compliant behavior as well.&amp;nbsp; In LLVM, this can be enabled by setting the unsafe-math flag at the module level, or passing the -funsafe-math-optimizations to clang which then sets flags on the IR it generates.&amp;nbsp; Within this context the compiler often generates shorter sequences of instructions to compute results, and depending on the context this may be acceptable.&amp;nbsp; Fast-math is often used in computations where loss of precision is acceptable.&amp;nbsp; For example when computing the color of a pixel, even relatively low precision is likely to far exceed the perception abilities of the eye, making shorter instruction sequences an attractive trade-off.&amp;nbsp; In long-running simulations of physical events however loss of precision can mean that the simulation drifts from reality making the trade-off unacceptable.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; min-height: 13px;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; min-height: 13px;">&lt;span style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;">Several years ago LLVM IR instructions gained the ability of being annotated with flags that can drive optimizations with more granularity than an all-or-nothing decision at the module level.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;">&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>&lt;span style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;">The IR flags in question are:&lt;/span>&lt;span style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;">&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-kerning: none;">&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

When all the flags are are &lt;b>enabled&lt;/b>, we get the current fast-math behavior.&amp;nbsp; When these flags are &lt;b>disabled&lt;/b>, we get precise math behavior.&amp;nbsp; There are also several options available between these two models that may be attractive to some applications.&amp;nbsp; In the past year several members of the LLVM community worked on making IR optimizations passes aware of these flags.&amp;nbsp; When the unsafe-math module flag is not set these optimization passes will work by examining individual flags, allowing fine-grained selection of the optimizations that can be enabled on specific instruction sequences.&amp;nbsp; This allows vendors/implementors to mix fast and precise computations in the same module, aggressively optimizing some instruction sequences but not others.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);

Historically, LLVM has in practice basically “split the difference” with regard to such transforms; they haven’t been explicitly disallowed, as LLVM doesn’t model the floating-point environment, but they have been disabled when they caused trouble for tests or software projects. The absence of a formal model for licensing these transforms constrains our ability to enable them. Bringing language and backend support for constrained intrinsics across the finish line will allow us to include transforms that we disable as a matter of practicality today, and allow us to give developers an easy escape valve (in the form of FENV_ACCESS ON and similar language controls) when they need more precise control, rather than an ad-hoc set of flags to pass to the driver.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; min-height: 13px;">&lt;span style="font-kerning: none; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;">&lt;span style="font-kerning: none; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">We should discuss these new intrinsics to make sure that they can capture the right models for all the languages that LLVM supports.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 9px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; min-height: 10px;">&lt;span style="font-kerning: none; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 9px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; min-height: 10px;">&lt;span style="font-kerning: none; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal;">&lt;span style="font-kerning: none; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">Here are some possible discussion items:&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">&lt;span style="font-kerning: none; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">Should specialization be applied at the call level for edges in a call graph where the caller has special context to extend into the callee wrt to flags?&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">&lt;span style="font-kerning: none; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">Should the inliner apply something similar to calls that meet inlining criteria?&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">&lt;span style="font-kerning: none; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">What other part(s) of the compiler could make use of IR flags that are currently not covered?&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Menlo; font-size: 11px; font-stretch: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">&lt;span style="font-kerning: none; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">What work needs to be done regarding code debt wrt current areas of implementation.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>FOSDEM 2019 LLVM developer room report</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2019/03/fosdem-2019-llvm-developer-room-report.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2019 02:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2019/03/fosdem-2019-llvm-developer-room-report.html</guid><description>

&lt;h2>Background&lt;/h2> &lt;p>In the course of adding Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) compatible Windows support to Clang, we worked hard to make sure the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/dllexport-dllimport?view=vs-2017">dllexport and dllimport declspecs&lt;/a> are handled the same way by Clang as by MSVC.&lt;/p> &lt;p>dllexport and dllimport are used to specify what functions and variables should be externally accessible ("exported") from the currently compiled Dynamic-Link Library (DLL), or should be accessed ("imported") from another DLL. In the class declaration below, &lt;code>S::foo()&lt;/code> will be exported when building a DLL:&lt;/p> &lt;pre style="text-indent:0">&lt;br />struct __declspec(dllexport) S {&lt;br /> void foo() {}&lt;br />};&lt;br />&lt;/pre> &lt;p>and code using that DLL would typically see a declaration like this:&lt;/p> &lt;pre style="text-indent:0">&lt;br />struct __declspec(dllimport) S {&lt;br /> void foo() {}&lt;br />};&lt;br />&lt;/pre> &lt;p>to indicate that the function is defined in and should be accessed from another DLL.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Often the same declaration is used along with a &lt;a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/72.0.3608.5/base/base_export.h">preprocessor macro&lt;/a> to flip between dllexport and dllimport, depending on whether a DLL is being built or consumed.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The basic idea of dllexport and dllimport is simple, but the semantics get more complicated as they interact with more facets of the C++ language: templates, inheritance, different kinds of instantiation, redeclarations with different declspecs, and so on. Sometimes the semantics are surprising, but by now we think clang-cl gets most of them right. And as the old maxim goes, once you know the rules well, you can start tactfully breaking them.&lt;/p> &lt;p>One issue with dllexport is that for inline functions such as &lt;code>S::foo()&lt;/code> above, the compiler must emit the definition &lt;em>even if it's not used in the translation unit&lt;/em>. That's because the DLL must export it, and the compiler cannot know if any other translation unit will provide a definition.&lt;/p> &lt;p>This is very inefficient. A dllexported class with inline members in a header file will cause definitions of those members to be emitted in &lt;em>every translation unit that includes the header&lt;/em>, directly or indirectly. And as we know, C++ source files often end up including a lot of headers. This behaviour is also different from non-Windows systems, where inline function definitions are not emitted unless they're used, even in shared objects and dynamic libraries.&lt;/p> &lt;h2>/Zc:dllexportInlines-&lt;/h2> &lt;p>To address this problem, clang-cl recently gained a new command-line flag, &lt;a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#the-zc-dllexportinlines-option">/Zc:dllexportInlines-&lt;/a> (MSVC uses the /Zc: prefix for &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/zc-conformance?view=vs-2017">language conformance options&lt;/a>). The basic idea is simple: since the definition of an inline function is available along with its declaration, it's not necessary to import or export it from a DLL &amp;mdash; the inline definition can be used directly. The effect of the flag is to not apply class-level dllexport/dllimport declspecs to inline member functions. In the two examples above, it means &lt;code>S::foo()&lt;/code> would not be dllexported or dllimported, even though the &lt;code>S&lt;/code> class is declared as such.&lt;/p> &lt;p>This is very similar to the &lt;a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#index-fvisibility-inlines-hidden">-fvisibility-inlines-hidden&lt;/a> Clang and GCC flag used on non-Windows. For C++ projects with many inline functions, it can significantly reduce the set of exported functions, and thereby the symbol table and file size of the shared object or dynamic library, as well as program load time.&lt;/p> &lt;p>On Windows however, the main benefit is not having to emit the unused inline function definitions. This means the compiler has to do much less work, and reduces object file size which in turn reduces the work for the linker. For Chrome, we &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/chromium-dev/xYVt4PFeObA/tc7CE3ojBgAJ">saw 30&amp;nbsp;% faster full builds&lt;/a>, 30&amp;nbsp;% shorter link times for blink_core.dll, and 40&amp;nbsp;% smaller total .obj file size.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The reduction in .obj file size, combined with the enormous reduction in .lib files allowed by previously switching linkers to lld-link which uses thin archives, means that a typical Chrome build directory is now 60&amp;nbsp;% smaller than it would have been just a year ago.&lt;/p> &lt;p>(Some of the same benefit can be had without this flag if the dllexport inline function comes from a pre-compiled header (PCH) file. In that case, the definition will be emitted in the object file when building the PCH, and so is not emitted elsewhere unless it's used.)&lt;/p> &lt;h2>Compatibility&lt;/h2> &lt;p>Using /Zc:dllexportInlines- is "half ABI incompatible". If it's used to build a DLL, inline members will no longer be exported, so any code using the DLL must use the same flag to not dllimport those members. However, the reverse scenario generally works: a DLL compiled without the flag (such as a system DLL built with MSVC) can be referenced from code that uses the flag, meaning that the referencing code will use the inline definitions instead of importing them from the DLL.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Like -fvisibility-inlines-hidden, /Zc:dllexportInlines- breaks the C++ language guarantee that (even an inline) function has a unique address within the program. When using these flags, an inline function will have a different address when used inside the library and outside.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Also, these flags can lead to link errors when inline functions, which would normally be dllimported, refer to internal symbols of a DLL:&lt;/p> &lt;pre style="text-indent:0">&lt;br />void internal();&lt;br />&lt;br />struct __declspec(dllimport) S {&lt;br /> void foo() { internal(); }&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre> &lt;p>Normally, references to &lt;code>S::foo()&lt;/code> would use the definition in the DLL, which also contains the definition of &lt;code>internal()&lt;/code>, but when using /Zc:dllexportInlines-, the inline definition of &lt;code>S::foo()&lt;/code> is used directly, resulting in a link error since no definition of &lt;code>internal()&lt;/code> can be found.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Even worse, if there is an inline definition of &lt;code>internal()&lt;/code> containing a static local variable, the program will now refer to a different instance of that variable than in the DLL:&lt;/p> &lt;pre style="text-indent:0">&lt;br />inline int internal() { static int x; return x++; }&lt;br />&lt;br />struct __declspec(dllimport) S {&lt;br /> int foo() { return internal(); }&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre> &lt;p>This could lead to very subtle bugs. However, since Chrome already uses -fvisibility-inlines-hidden, which has the same potential problem, we believe this is not a common issue.&lt;/p> &lt;h2>Summary&lt;/h2> &lt;p>/Zc:dllexportInlines- is like -fvisibility-inlines-hidden for DLLs and significantly reduces build times. We're excited that using Clang on Windows allows us to benefit from new features like this.&lt;/p> &lt;h2>More information&lt;/h2> &lt;p>For more information, see the &lt;a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#the-zc-dllexportinlines-option">User's Manual for /Zc:dllexportInlines-&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The flag was added in Clang &lt;a href="https://llvm.org/r346069">r346069&lt;/a>, which will be part of the Clang 8 release expected in March 2019. It's also available in the &lt;a href="https://llvm.org/builds/">Windows Snapshot Build&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;h2>Acknowledgements&lt;/h2> &lt;p>/Zc:dllexportInlines- was implemented by Takuto Ikuta based on a prototype by Nico Weber.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Integration of libc++ and OpenMP packages into llvm-toolchain</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2018/09/integration-of-libc-and-openmp-packages.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Sep 2018 08:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2018/09/integration-of-libc-and-openmp-packages.html</guid><description>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/foundation/">LLVM Foundation&lt;/a> is pleased to announce its new Board of Directors:&lt;/p> &lt;br>Chandler Carruth &lt;br>Mike Edwards (Treasurer) &lt;br>Hal Finkel &lt;br>Arnaud de Grandmaison &lt;br>Anton Korobeynikov &lt;br>Tanya Lattner (President) &lt;br>Chris Lattner &lt;br>John Regehr (Secretary) &lt;br>Tom Stellard &lt;p>Two new members and seven continuing members were elected to the nine person board. &lt;/p> &lt;p>We want to thank David Kipping for his 2 terms on the board. David has been actively involved with the LLVM Developer Meetings and was the treasurer for the past 4 years. The treasurer is a time demanding position in that he supports the day to day operation of the foundation, balancing the books, and generates monthly treasurer reports. &lt;/p> &lt;p>We also want to thank all the applicants to the board. When voting on new board members, we took into consideration all contributions (past and present) and current involvement in the LLVM community. We also tried to create a balanced board of individuals from a wide range of backgrounds and locations to provide a voice to as many groups within the LLVM community. Given this criteria and strong applicants, we increased the board from 8 members to 9.&lt;/p> &lt;p>About the board of directors (listed alphabetically by last name):&lt;/p> &lt;br>&lt;b>Chandler Carruth:&lt;/b>&lt;p>Chandler Carruth has been an active contributor to LLVM since 2007.

Python 2/3 wheels are available for Linux/OSX x86/x64. Python 3.6 wheels are available for Windows x64. On all these architectures, just use:&lt;br />&lt;pre class="code bash literal-block">$ pip install pydffi&lt;br />&lt;/pre>and play with it :)&lt;br />&lt;br />See below for more information.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h3>Related work&lt;/h3>&lt;tt class="docutils literal">libffi&lt;/tt> is the reference library that provides a FFI for the C language. &lt;tt class="docutils literal">cffi&lt;/tt>&amp;nbsp;is a Python binding around this library that also uses &lt;tt class="docutils literal">PyCParser&lt;/tt>to be able to easily declare interfaces and types. Both these libraries have limitations, among them:&lt;br />&lt;ul class="simple">&lt;li>&lt;tt class="docutils literal">libffi&lt;/tt> does not support the Microsoft x64 ABI under Linux x64. It isn't that trivial to add a new ABI (hand-written ABI, get the ABI right, ...), while a lot of effort have already been put into compilers to get these ABIs right.&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;tt class="docutils literal">PyCParser&lt;/tt> only supports a very limited subset of C (no includes, function attributes, ...).&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Moreover, in 2014, Jordan Rose and John McCall from Apple made a &lt;a href="https://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/Slides/Skip%20the%20FFI.pdf">talk&lt;/a> at the LLVM developer meeting of San José about how Clang can be used for C interoperability. This talk also shows various ABI issues, and has been a source of inspiration for DragonFFI at the beginning.&lt;br />&lt;br />Somehow related, Sean Callanan, who worked on &lt;tt class="docutils literal">lldb&lt;/tt>, gave a &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2017-10/#talk5">talk&lt;/a> in 2017 at the LLVM developer meeting of San José on how we could use parts of Clang/LLVM to implement some kind of &lt;tt class="docutils literal">eval()&lt;/tt> for C++. What can be learned from this talk is that debuggers like &lt;tt class="docutils literal">lldb&lt;/tt>&amp;nbsp;must also be able to call an arbitrary C function, and uses debug information among other things to solve it (what we also do, see below :)).&lt;br />&lt;br />DragonFFI is based on Clang/LLVM, and thanks to that it is able to get around these issues:&lt;br />&lt;ul class="simple">&lt;li>it uses Clang to parse header files, allowing direct usage of a C library headers without adaptation;&lt;/li>&lt;li>it support as many calling conventions and function attributes as Clang/LLVM do;&lt;/li>&lt;li>as a bonus, Clang and LLVM allows on-the-fly compilation of C functions, without relying on the presence of a compiler on the system (you still need the headers of the system's libc thought, or MSVCRT headers under Windows);&lt;/li>&lt;li>and this is a good way to have fun with Clang and LLVM! :)&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Let's dive in!&lt;br />&lt;h3>Creating an FFI library for C&lt;/h3>&lt;h4>Supporting C ABIs&lt;/h4>A C function is always compiled for a given C ABI. The C ABI isn't defined per the official C standards, and is system/architecture-dependent. Lots of things are defined by these ABIs, and it can be quite error prone to implement.&lt;br />&lt;br />To see how ABIs can become complex, let's compile this C code:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre class="code c literal-block">&lt;span class="keyword">typedef&lt;/span> &lt;span class="keyword">struct&lt;/span> &lt;span class="punctuation">{&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span class="keyword

/>What happens here is what is called &lt;i>structure coercion&lt;/i>. To optimize some function calls, some ABIs pass structure values through registers. For instance, an &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">llvm::ArrayRef&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> object, which is basically a structure with a pointer and a size (see &lt;a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/release_60/include/llvm/ADT/ArrayRef.h#L51">https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/release_60/include/llvm/ADT/ArrayRef.h#L51&lt;/a>), is passed through registers (though this optimization isn't guaranteed by any standard).&lt;br />&lt;br />It is important to understand that ABIs are complex things to implement and we don't want to redo this whole work by ourselves, particularly when LLVM/Clang already know how.&lt;br />&lt;h4>Finding the right type abstraction&lt;/h4>We want to list every types that is used in a parsed C file. To achieve that goal, various information are needed, among which:&lt;br />&lt;ul class="simple">&lt;li>the function types, and their calling convention&lt;/li>&lt;li>for structures: field offsets and names&lt;/li>&lt;li>for union/enums: field names (and values)&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>On one hand, we have seen in the previous section that the LLVM IR is too Low Level (as in &lt;b>Low Level&lt;/b> Virtual Machine) for this. On the other hand, Clang's AST is too high level. Indeed, let's print the Clang AST of the code above:&lt;br />&lt;pre class="code bash literal-block">&lt;span class="operator">[&lt;/span>...&lt;span class="operator">]&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="punctuation">|&lt;/span>-RecordDecl 0x5561d7f9fc20 &amp;lt;a.c:1:9, line:4:1&amp;gt; line:1:9 struct definition&lt;br />&lt;span class="punctuation">|&lt;/span> &lt;span class="punctuation">|&lt;/span>-FieldDecl 0x5561d7ff4750 &amp;lt;line:2:3, col:9&amp;gt; col:9 referenced a &lt;span class="literal string single">'short'&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="punctuation">|&lt;/span> &lt;span class="literal string backtick">`&lt;/span>-FieldDecl 0x5561d7ff47b0 &amp;lt;line:3:3, col:7&amp;gt; col:7 referenced b &lt;span class="literal string single">'int'&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>We can see that there is no information about the structure layout (padding, ...). There's also no information about the size of standard C types. As all of this depends on the backend used, it is not surprising that these informations are not present in the AST.&lt;br />&lt;br />The right abstraction appears to be the LLVM metadata produced by Clang to emit DWARF or PDB structures. They provide structure fields offset/name, various basic type descriptions, and function calling conventions. Exactly what we need! For the example above, this gives (at the LLVM IR level, with some inline comments):&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre class="code llvm literal-block">&lt;span class="keyword">target&lt;/span> &lt;span class="keyword">triple&lt;/span> &lt;span class="punctuation">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="literal string">"x86_64-pc-linux-gnu"&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="name variable">%struct.A&lt;/span>

This custom type system has been created for two reasons:&lt;br />&lt;ul class="simple">&lt;li>create a type system that gathers only the necessary informations from the metadata tree (we don't need the whole debug informations)&lt;/li>&lt;li>make the public headers of the DragonFFI library free from any LLVM headers (so that the whole LLVM headers aren't needed to use the library)&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Once we've got this type system, the DragonFFI API for calling C functions is this one:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre class="code cpp literal-block">&lt;span class="name">DFFI&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name function">FFI&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">([...]);&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="comment single">// This will declare puts as a function that returns int and takes a const&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/pre>&lt;pre class="code cpp literal-block">&lt;span class="comment single">// char* as an argument. We could also create this function type by hand.&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">CompilationUnit&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">CU&lt;/span> &lt;span class="operator">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">FFI&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">cdef&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="literal string">"int puts(const char* s);"&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">,&lt;/span> &lt;span class="punctuation">[...]);&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="name">NativeFunc&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">F&lt;/span> &lt;span class="operator">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">CU&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">getFunction&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="literal string">"puts"&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">);&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="keyword">const&lt;/span> &lt;span class="keyword type">char&lt;/span>&lt;span class="operator">*&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">s&lt;/span> &lt;span class="operator">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="literal string">"hello world!"&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="keyword type">void&lt;/span>&lt;span class="operator">*&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">Args&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">[]&lt;/span> &lt;span class="operator">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="punctuation">{&lt;/span>&lt;span class="operator">&amp;amp;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">s&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">};&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="keyword type">int&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">Ret&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="name">F&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">call&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="operator">&amp;amp;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">Ret&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">,&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">Args&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">);&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />So, basically, a pointer to the returned data and an array of &lt;tt class="docutils literal">void*&lt;/tt> is given to DragonFFI. Each &lt;tt class="docutils literal">void*&lt;/tt> value is a pointer to the data that must be passed to the underlying function. So the last missing piece of the puzzle is the code that takes this array of &lt;tt class="docutils literal">void*&lt;/tt> (and pointer to the returned data) and calls &lt;tt class="docutils literal">puts&lt;/tt>, so a function like this:&lt;br />&lt;pre class="code cpp literal-block">&lt;span class="keyword type">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/pre>&lt;pre class="code cpp literal-block">&lt;span class="keyword type">void&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name function">call_puts&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="keyword type">void&lt;/span>&lt;span class="operator">*&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">Ret&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">,&lt;/span> &lt;span class="keyword type">void&lt;/span>&lt;span class="operator">**&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">Args&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">)&lt;/span> &lt;span class="punctuation">{&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span class="operator">*&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">((&lt;/span>&lt;span class="keyword type">int&lt;/span>&lt;span class="operator">*&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">)&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">Ret&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">)&lt;/span> &lt;span class="operator">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">puts&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">((&lt;/span>&lt;span class="keyword">const&lt;/span> &lt;span class="keyword type">char&lt;/span>&lt;span class="operator">*&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">)&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">Args&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">[&lt;/span>&lt;span class="literal number integer">0&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">]);&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="punctuation">}&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />We call these "function wrappers" (how original! :)). One advantage of this signature is that it is a generic signature, which can be used in the implementation of DragonFFI. Supposing we manage to compile at run-time this function, we can then call it trivially as in the following:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre class="code cpp literal-block">&lt;span class="keyword">typedef&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name function">void&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="operator">*&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">puts_call_ty&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">)(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="keyword type">void&lt;/span>&lt;span class="operator">*&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">,&lt;/span> &lt;span class="keyword type">void&lt;/span>&lt;span class="operator">**&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">);&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="name">puts_call_ty&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">Wrapper&lt;/span> &lt;span class="operator">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="comment multiline">/* pointer to the compiled wrapper function */;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="name">Wrapper&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">Ret&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">,&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">Args&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">);&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;pre class="code cpp literal-block">&lt;span class="punctuation">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/pre>Generating and compiling a function like this is something Clang/LLVM is able to do. For the record, this is also what &lt;tt class="docutils literal">libffi&lt;/tt> mainly does, by generating the necessary assembly &lt;i>by hand&lt;/i>. We optimize the number of these wrappers in DragonFFI, by generating them for each different function type. So, the actual wrapper that would be generated for &lt;tt class="docutils literal">puts&lt;/tt> is actually this one:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre class="code cpp literal-block">&lt;span class="keyword type">void&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name function">__dffi_wrapper_0&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="keyword type">int32_t&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">(&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">__attribute__&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">((&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">cdecl&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">))&lt;/span> &lt;span class="operator">*&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">__FPtr&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">)(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="keyword type">char&lt;/span> &lt;span class="operator">*&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">),&lt;/span> &lt;span class="keyword type">int32_t&lt;/span> &lt;span class="operator">*&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">__Ret&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">,&lt;/span> &lt;span class="keyword type">void&lt;/span>&lt;span class="operator">**&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">__Args&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">)&lt;/span> &lt;span class="punctuation">{&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span class="operator">*&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">__Ret&lt;/span> &lt;span class="operator">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="punctuation">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">__FPtr&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">)(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="operator">*&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">((&lt;/span>&lt;span class="keyword type">char&lt;/span> &lt;span class="operator">**&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">)&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">__Args&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">[&lt;/span>&lt;span class="literal number integer">0&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">]));&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="punctuation">}&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;pre class="code cpp literal-block">&lt;span class="punctuation">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/pre>For now, all the necessary wrappers are generated when the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">DFFI::cdef&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> or &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">DFFI::compile&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> APIs are used. The only exception where they are generated on-the-fly (when calling &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">CompilationUnit::getFunction&lt;/span>&lt;/tt>) is for variadic arguments. One possible evolution is to let the user chooses whether he wants this to happen on-the-fly or not for every declared function.&lt;br />&lt;h3>Issues with Clang&lt;/h3>There is one major issue with Clang that we need to hack around in order to have the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">DFFI::cdef&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> functionality: unused declarations aren't emitted by Clang (even when using &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">-g&lt;/span> &lt;span class="pre">-femit-all-decls&lt;/span>&lt;/tt>).&lt;br />&lt;br />Here is an example, produced from the following C code:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre class="code c literal-block">&lt;span class="keyword">typedef&lt;/span> &lt;span class="keyword">struct&lt;/span> &lt;span class="punctuation">{&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span class="keyword type">short&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">a&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">;&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span class="keyword type">int&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">b&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="punctuation">}&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">A&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span class="keyword type">void&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name function">print_A&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">A&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">s&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">);&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;pre class="code sh literal-block">$ clang -S -emit-llvm -g -femit-all-decls -o - a.c &lt;span class="punctuation">|&lt;/span>grep print_A &lt;span class="punctuation">|&lt;/span>wc -l&lt;br />&lt;span class="literal number">0&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />The produced LLVM IR does not contain a function named &lt;tt class="docutils literal">print_A&lt;/tt>! The hack we temporarily use parses the clang AST and generates temporary functions that looks like this:&lt;br />&lt;pre class="code cpp literal-block">&lt;span class="keyword type">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/pre>&lt;pre class="code cpp literal-block">&lt;span class="keyword type">void&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name function">__dffi_force_decl_print_A&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="name">A&lt;/span> &lt;span class="name">s&lt;/span>&lt;span class="punctuation">)&lt;/span> &lt;span class="punctuation">{&lt;/span> &lt;span class="punctuation">}&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />This forces LLVM to generate an empty function named &lt;tt class="docutils literal">__dffi_force_decl_print_A&lt;/tt> with the good arguments (and associated debug informations).&lt;br />&lt;br />This is why DragonFFI proposes another API, &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">DFFI::compile&lt;/span>&lt;/tt>. This API does not force declared-only functions to be present in the LLVM IR, and will only expose functions that end up naturally in the LLVM IR after optimizations.&lt;br />&lt;br />If someone has a better idea to handle this, please let us know! &lt;br />&lt;h3>Python bindings&lt;/h3>Python bindings were the first ones to have been written, simply because it's the "high level" language I know best. &amp;nbsp;Python provides its own set of challenges, but we will save that for another blog post. &amp;nbsp;These Python bindings are built using &lt;a href="https://github.com/pybind/pybind11">pybind11&lt;/a>, and provides their own set of C types. Lots of example of what can be achieved can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/aguinet/dragonffi/tree/dffi-0.2.1/examples">here&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/aguinet/dragonffi/tree/dffi-0.2.1/bindings/python/tests">here&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;h3>Project status&lt;/h3>DragonFFI currently supports Linux, OSX and Windows OSes, running on Intel 32 and 64-bits CPUs. Travis is used for continuous integration, and every changes is validated on all these platforms before being integrated.&lt;br />&lt;br />The project will go from alpha to beta quality when the 0.3 version will be out (which will bring Travis and Appveyor CI integration and support for variadic functions). The project will be considered stable once these things happen:&lt;br />&lt;ul class="simple">&lt;li>user and developer documentations exist!&lt;/li>&lt;li>another foreign language is supported (JS? Ruby?)&lt;/li>&lt;li>the DragonFFI main library API is considered stable&lt;/li>&lt;li>a non negligible list of tests have been added&lt;/li>&lt;li>all the things in the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">TODO&lt;/tt> file have been done :)&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Various ideas for the future&lt;/h3>Here are various interesting ideas we have for the future. We don't know yet when they will be implemented, but we think some of them could be quite nice to have.&lt;br />&lt;h4>Parse embedded DWARF information&lt;/h4>As the entry point of DragonFFI are DWARF informations, we could imagine parsing these debug informations from shared libraries that embed them (or provide them in a separate file). The main advantage is that all the necessary information for doing the FFI right are in one file, the header files are no longer required. The main drawback is that debug informations tend to take a lot of space (for instance, DWARF informations take 1.8Mb for &lt;tt class="docutils literal">libarchive&lt;/tt> 3.32 compiled in release mode, for an original binary code size of 735Kb), and this brings us to the next idea.&lt;br />&lt;h4>Lightweight debug info?&lt;/h4>The DWARF standard allows to define lots of information, and we don't need all of them in our case. We could imagine embedding only the necessary DWARF objects, that is just the necessary types to call the exported functions of a shared library. One experiment of this is available here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/aguinet/llvm-lightdwarf">https://github.com/aguinet/llvm-lightdwarf&lt;/a>. This is an LLVM optimisation pass that is inserted at the end of the optimisation pipeline, and parse metadata to only keep the relevant one for DragonFFI. More precisely, it only keeps the dwarf metadata related to &lt;b>exported&lt;/b> and &lt;b>visible&lt;/b> functions, with the associated types. It also keeps debug information of global variables, even thought these ones aren't supported yet in DragonFFI. It also does some unconventional things, like replacing every file and directory by "_", to save space. "Fun" fact, to do this, it borrows some code from the LLVM bitcode "obfuscator" included in recent Apple's clang version, that is used to anonymize some information from the LLVM bitcode that is sent with tvOS/iOS applications (see &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095588.html">http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095588.html&lt;/a> for more information).&lt;br />&lt;br />Enough talking, let's see some preliminary results (on Linux x64):&lt;br />&lt;ul class="simple">&lt;li>on libarchive 3.3.2, DWARF goes from 1.8Mb to 536Kb, for an original binary code size of 735Kb&lt;/li>&lt;li>on zlib 1.2.11, DWARF goes from 162Kb to 61Kb, for an original binary code size of 99Kb&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>The instructions to reproduce this are available in the README of the LLVM pass repository.&lt;br />We can conclude that defining this "light" DWARF format could be a nice idea. One other thing that could be done is defining a new binary format, that would be thus more space-efficient, but there are drawbacks going this way:&lt;br />&lt;ul class="simple">&lt;li>debug informations are well supported on every platform nowadays: tools exist to parse them, embed/extract them from binary, and so on&lt;/li>&lt;li>we already got DWARD and PDB: &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">https://xkcd.com/927/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Nevertheless, it still could be a nice experiment to try and do this, figuring out the space won and see if this is worth it!&lt;br />&lt;br />As a final note, these two ideas would also benefit to &lt;tt class="docutils literal">libffi&lt;/tt>, as we could process these formats and create &lt;tt class="docutils literal">libffi&lt;/tt> types!&lt;br />&lt;h4>JIT code from the final language (like Python) to native function code&lt;/h4>One advantage of embedding a full working C compiler is that we could JIT the code from the final language glue to the final C function call, and thus limit the performance impact of this glue code.&lt;br />Indeed, when a call is issued from Python, the following things happen:&lt;br />&lt;ul class="simple">&lt;li>arguments are converted from Python to C according to the function type&lt;/li>&lt;li>the function pointer and wrapper and gathered from DragonFFI&lt;/li>&lt;li>the final call is made&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>All this process involves basically a loop on the types of the arguments of the called function, which contains a big switch case. This loop generates the array of &lt;tt class="docutils literal">void*&lt;/tt> values that represents the C arguments, which is then passed to the wrapper. We could JIT a specialised version of this loop for the function type, inline the already-compiled wrapper and apply classical optimisation on top of the resulting IR, and get a straightforward conversion code specialized for the given function type, directly from Python to C.&lt;br />&lt;br />One idea we are exploring is combining &lt;a href="https://github.com/jmmartinez/easy-just-in-time">easy::jit&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;(hello fellow Quarkslab teammates!) with &lt;a href="http://www.llpe.org/">LLPE&lt;/a> to achieve this goal.&lt;br />&lt;h4>Reducing DragonFFI library size&lt;/h4>The DragonFFI shared library embed statically compiled versions of LLVM and Clang. The size of the final shared library is about 55Mb (stripped, under Linux x64). This is really really huge, compared for instance to the 39Kb of libffi (also stripped, Linux x64)!&lt;br />&lt;br />Here are some idea to try and reduce this footprint:&lt;br />&lt;ul class="simple">&lt;li>compile DragonFFI, Clang and LLVM using (Thin) LTO, with visibility hidden for both Clang and LLVM. This could have the effect of removing code from Clang/LLVM that isn't used by DragonFFI.&lt;/li>&lt;li>make DragonFFI more modular: - one core module that only have the parts from CodeGen that deals with ABIs. If the types and function prototypes are defined "by hand" (without &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">DFFI::cdef&lt;/span>&lt;/tt>), that's more or less the only part that is needed (with LLVM obviously) - one optional module that includes the full clang compiler (to provide the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">DFFI::cdef&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> and &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">DFFI::compile&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> APIs)&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Even with all of this, it seems to be really hard to match the 39Kb of &lt;tt class="docutils literal">libffi&lt;/tt>, even if we remove the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">cdef&lt;/tt>/&lt;tt class="docutils literal">compile&lt;/tt> API from DragonFFI. As always, pick the right tool for your needs :)&lt;br />&lt;h3>Conclusion&lt;/h3>Writing the first working version of DragonFFI has been a fun experiment, that made me discover new parts of Clang/LLVM :) The current goal is to try and achieve a first stable version (see above), and experiment with the various cited ideas.&lt;br />&lt;br />It's a really long road, so feel free to come on &lt;tt class="docutils literal">#dragonffi&lt;/tt> on FreeNode for any questions/suggestions you might have, (inclusive) or if you want to contribute! &lt;br />&lt;h3>Acknowledgments&lt;/h3>Thanks to Serge «sans paille» Guelton for the discussions around the Python bindings, and for helping me finding the name of the project :) (one of the most difficult task).

&lt;br />Today is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women%27s_Day">International Women's Day&lt;/a>! To all the women in the LLVM community, thank you for all your contributions!&lt;br />&lt;br />The &lt;a href="http://foundation.llvm.org/">LLVM Foundation&lt;/a> values diversity within the LLVM community and the field of compilers and tools. Our Women in Compilers and Tools program began in 2015 with a birds of a feather discussion during the US LLVM Developers' Meeting and we have been expanding it over the years.&lt;br />&lt;br />In 2017, we were a sponsor of the &lt;a href="https://ghc.anitab.org/ghc-17/">Grace Hopper Conference&lt;/a>. With the help of community members Anna Zaks and David Blaikie, the LLVM Foundation had a booth at the career fair to introduce women to LLVM and encourage them to become contributors. It was very exciting to learn that many women knew of LLVM, were using it in their classes or research, using it in their career, or were interested in learning more. We hopefully encouraged more women to get involved with LLVM, compilers, and open source.&lt;br />&lt;br />The LLVM Foundation was also a sponsor of the &lt;a href="https://2017.splashcon.org/track/splash-2017-PLMW">Programming Language Mentoring Workshop&lt;/a> at SPLASH 2017. Our sponsorship went towards the travel costs for many women and other minorities to attend this workshop. The workshop focused on encouraging and preparing students to enter research careers in the field of programming languages, compilers, and related fields and to provide first hand perspectives on graduate school.&lt;br />&lt;br />We hosted our first Women in Compilers &amp;amp; Tools reception before the 2017 US LLVM Developers' Meeting. Anna Zaks and Alice Chan participated in a panel discussion about the challenges and experiences that they have encountered in their careers and within the open source community. The event was attended by 60 members of the LLVM community.&lt;br />&lt;br />In 2018, we look forward to another year of expanding our program. The LLVM Foundation will again sponsor the Grace Hopper Conference and we are looking for LLVM community members to help out at the career booth (more details to come). We will be having two Women in Compilers and Tools events. The first will have a reception and panel discussion before the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2018-04/">2018 EuroLLVM Developers' Meeting&lt;/a>. Get your tickets &lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2018-european-llvm-developers-meeting-women-in-compilers-and-tools-reception-tickets-42287427835">here&lt;/a>. The second will be before the 2018 US LLVM Developers' Meeting and details will be announced in the coming months.&lt;br />&lt;br />The LLVM Foundation thanks the LLVM community and its sponsors for supporting this work. If you want to participate in the discussion or receive notifications on events, please join the &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/wict">Women in Compilers and Tools mailing list&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />Question for the LLVM Foundation?

&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&lt;div style="text-align: left;">As of Chrome 64, Chrome for Windows is compiled with Clang. We now use Clang to build Chrome for all platforms it runs on: macOS, iOS, Linux, Chrome OS, Android, and Windows. Windows is the platform with the second most Chrome users after Android &lt;a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-version-market-share">according to statcounter&lt;/a>, which made this switch particularly exciting.&lt;/div>&lt;br />Clang is the first-ever open-source C++ compiler that’s ABI-compatible with Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) – meaning you can build some parts of your program (for example, system libraries) with the MSVC compiler (“cl.exe”), other parts with Clang, and when linked together (either by MSVC’s linker, “link.exe”, or LLD, the LLVM project’s linker – see below) the parts will form a working program.&lt;br />&lt;br />Note that Clang is not a replacement for Visual Studio, but an addition to it. We still use Microsoft’s headers and libraries to build Chrome, we still use some SDK binaries like midl.exe and mc.exe, and many Chrome/Win developers still use the Visual Studio IDE (for both development and for debugging).&lt;br />&lt;br />This post discusses numbers, motivation, benefits and drawbacks of using Clang instead of MSVC, how to try out Clang for Windows yourself, project history, and next steps. For more information on the technical side you can look at the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oxNHaVjA9Gn_rTzX6HIpJHP7nXRua_0URXxxJ3oYRq0/edit#slide=id.p">slides of our 2015 LLVM conference talk&lt;/a>, and the slides linked from there.&lt;br />&lt;h3>Numbers&lt;/h3>This is what most people ask about first, so let’s talk about it first. We think the other sections are more interesting though.&lt;br />&lt;h4 style="text-align: left;">Build time&lt;/h4>Building Chrome locally with Clang is about 15% slower than with MSVC. (We’ve heard that Windows Defender can make Clang builds a lot slower on some machines, so if you’re seeing larger slowdowns, make sure to whitelist Clang in Windows Defender.) However, the way Clang emits debug info is more parallelizable and builds with a distributed build service (e.g. &lt;a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/goma/client/">Goma&lt;/a>) are hence faster.&lt;br />&lt;h4 style="text-align: left;">Binary size&lt;/h4>Chrome installer size gets smaller for 64-bit builds and slightly larger for 32-bit builds using Clang. The same difference shows in uncompressed code size for regular builds as well (see the &lt;a href="https://crbug.com/457078">tracking bug for Clang binary size&lt;/a> for many numbers). However, compared to MSVC builds using link-time code generation (LTCG) and &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2016/10/making-chrome-on-windows-faster-with-pgo.html">profile-guided optimization&lt;/a> (PGO) Clang generates larger code in 64-bit for targets that use /O2 but smaller code for targets that use /Os. The installer size comparison suggests Clang's output compresses better.&lt;br />&lt;br />Some raw numbers for versions 64.0.3278.2 (MSVC PGO) and 64.0.3278.0 (Clang). mini_installer.exe is Chrome’s installer that users download, containing the LZMA-compressed code. chrome_child.dll is one of the two main dlls; it contains Blink and V8, and generally has many targets that are built with /O2. chrome.dll is the other main dll, containing the browser process code, mostly built with /Os.&lt;br />&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-891146fc-f7de-b09a-1a30-b3298ec281f3">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;div dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 0pt;">&lt;table style="border-collapse: collapse;

Performance telemetry numbers are about the same for MSVC-built and clang-built Chrome – some metrics get better, some get worse, but all of them are within 5% of each other. The official MSVC builds used LTCG and PGO, while the Clang builds currently use neither of these. This is potential for improvement that we look forward to exploring. The PGO builds took a very long time to build due to the need for collecting profiles and then building again, and as a result, the configuration was not enabled on our performance-measurement buildbots. Now that we use Clang, the perf bots again track the configuration that we ship.&lt;br />&lt;br />Startup performance was worse in Clang-built Chrome until we started using a &lt;a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/win_order_files.md">link-order file&lt;/a> – a form of “PGO light” .&lt;br />&lt;h4 style="text-align: left;">Stability&lt;/h4>We A/B-tested stability as well and found no difference between the two build configurations.&lt;br />&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">Motivation&lt;/h3>There were many motivating reasons for this project, the overarching theme being the benefits of using the same compiler across all of Chrome’s platforms, as well as the ability to change the compiler and deploy those changes to all our developers and buildbots quickly. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of examples.&lt;br />&lt;ul style="text-align: left;">&lt;li>Chrome is heavily using technology that’s based on compiler instrumentation (ASan, CFI, &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2012/04/fuzzing-for-security.html">ClusterFuzz&lt;/a>—uses ASan). Clang supports this instrumentation already, but we can’t add it to MSVC. We previously used &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/syzygy">after-the-fact binary instrumentation&lt;/a> to mitigate this a bit, but having the toolchain write the right bits in the first place is cleaner and faster.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Clang enables us to write compiler &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/coding-style/chromium-style-checker-errors">plugins&lt;/a> that add Chromium-specific warnings and to write tooling for &lt;a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkcr/docs/clang_tool_refactoring.md">large-scale refactoring&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://cs.chromium.org/">Chromium’s code search&lt;/a> can now learn to index Windows code.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Chromium is open-source, so it’s nice if it’s built with an open-source toolchain.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Chrome runs on 6+ platforms, and most developers are only familiar with 1-3 platforms. If your patch doesn’t compile on a platform you’re unfamiliar with, due to a compiler error that you can’t locally reproduce on your local development machine, it’ll take you a while to fix. On the other hand, if all platforms use the same compiler, if it builds on your machine then it’s probably going to build on all platforms.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Using the same compiler also means that compiler-specific micro-optimizations will help on all platforms (assuming that the same -O flags are used on all platforms – not yet the case in Chrome, and only on the same ISAs – x86 vs ARM will stay different).&lt;/li>&lt;li>Using the same compiler enables &lt;a href="https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/docs/win_cross.md">cross-compiling&lt;/a> – developers who feel most at home on a Linux box can now work on Windows-specific code, from their Linux box (without needing to run Wine).&lt;/li>&lt;li>We can &lt;a href="https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/g/chromium.clang/console">continuously build Chrome trunk with Clang trunk&lt;/a> to find compiler regressions quickly. This allows us to update Clang every week or two. Landing a major MSVC update in Chrome usually took a year or more, with several rounds of reporting internal compiler bugs and miscompiles. The issue here isn’t that MSVC is more buggy than Clang – it isn’t, all software is buggy – but that we can continuously improve Clang due to Clang being open-source.&lt;/li>&lt;li>C++ receives major new revisions every few years. When C++11 was released, we were still using six different compilers, and &lt;a href="http://chromium-cpp.appspot.com/">enabling C++11&lt;/a> was difficult. With fewer compilers, this gets much easier.&lt;/li>&lt;li>We can prioritize compiler features that are important to us. For example:&lt;/li>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/isolated-testing/deterministic-builds">Deterministic builds&lt;/a> were important to us before they were important for the MSVC team. For example, link.exe /incremental depends on an incrementing mtime timestamp in each object file.&lt;/li>&lt;li>We could enable warnings that fired in system headers long before &lt;a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2017/12/13/broken-warnings-theory/">MSVC added support for the system header concept&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>&lt;li>cl.exe always prints the name of the input file, so that the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/blob/master/src/clparser.cc#L67">build system has to filter it out for quiet builds&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;/ul>&lt;br />Of course, not all – or even most – of these reasons will apply to other projects.&lt;br />&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">Benefits and drawbacks of using Clang instead of Visual C++&lt;/h3>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">Benefits of using Clang, if you want to try for your project:&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">&lt;/div>&lt;ul style="text-align: left;">&lt;li>Clang supports 64-bit inline assembly. For example, in Chrome we built libyuv (a video format conversion library) with Clang long before we built all of Chrome with it. libyuv had highly-tuned 64-bit inline assembly with performance not reachable with intrinsics, and we could just use that code on Windows.&lt;/li>&lt;li>If your project runs on multiple platforms, you can use one compiler everywhere. Building your project with several compilers is generally considered good for code health, but in Chrome we found that Clang’s diagnostics found most problems and we were mostly battling compiler bugs (and if another compiler has a great new diagnostic, we can add that to Clang).&lt;/li>&lt;li>Likewise, if your project is Windows-only, you can get a second compiler’s opinion on your code, and Clang’s warnings might find bugs.&lt;/li>&lt;li>You can use &lt;a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html">Address Sanitizer&lt;/a> to find memory bugs.&lt;/li>&lt;li>If you don’t use LTCG and PGO, it’s possible that Clang might create faster code.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Clang’s &lt;a href="https://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html">diagnostics and fix-it hints&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>There are also drawbacks:&lt;br />&lt;ul style="text-align: left;">&lt;li>Clang doesn’t support C++/CX or #import “foo.dll”.&lt;/li>&lt;li>MSVC offers paid support, Clang only gives you the code and the ability to write patches yourself (although the community is very active and helpful!).&lt;/li>&lt;li>MSVC has better documentation.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Advanced debugging features such as Edit &amp;amp; Continue don’t work when using Clang.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">How to use&lt;/h3>If you want to give Clang for Windows a try, there are two approaches:&lt;br />&lt;ol style="text-align: left;">&lt;li>You could use clang-cl, a compiler driver that tries to be command-line flag compatible with cl.exe (just like Clang tries to be command-line flag compatible with gcc). The &lt;a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#clang-cl">Clang user manual&lt;/a> describes how you can tell popular Windows build systems how to call clang-cl instead of cl.exe. We used this approach in Chrome to keep the Clang/Win build working alongside the MSVC build for years, with minimal maintenance cost. You can keep using link.exe, all your current compile flags, the MSVC debugger or windbg, ETW, etc. clang-cl even writes warning messages in a format that’s compatible with cl.exe so that you can click on build error messages in Visual Studio to jump to the right file and line. Everything should just work.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Alternatively, if you have a cross-platform project and want to use gcc-style flags for your Windows build, you can pass a Windows triple (e.g. --target=x86_64-windows-msvc) to regular Clang, and it will produce MSVC-ABI-compatible output. Starting in Clang 7.0.0, due Fall 2018, Clang will also default to CodeView debug info with this triple.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>Since Clang’s output is ABI-compatible with MSVC, you can build parts of your project with clang and other parts with MSVC. You can also pass &lt;a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#the-fallback-option">/fallback&lt;/a> to clang-cl to make it call cl.exe on files it can’t yet compile (this should be rare; it never happens in the Chrome build).&lt;br />&lt;br />clang-cl accepts Microsoft language extensions needed to parse system headers but tries to emit -Wmicrosoft-foo warnings when it does so (warnings are ignored for system headers). You can choose to fix your code, or pass -Wno-microsoft-foo to Clang.&lt;br />&lt;br />link.exe can produce regular PDB files from the CodeView information that Clang writes.&lt;br />&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">Project History&lt;/h3>We switched chrome/mac and &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2015/01/using-clang-for-chrome-production.html">chrome/linux&lt;/a> to Clang a while ago. But on Windows, Clang was still missing support for parsing many Microsoft language extensions, and it didn’t have any Microsoft C++ ABI-compatible codegen at all. In 2013, we &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2013/09/a-path-forward-for-llvm-toolchain-on.html">spun up a team&lt;/a> to improve Clang’s Windows support, consisting half of Chrome engineers with a compiler background and half of other toolchain people. In mid-2014, Clang could &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/clangllvm-on-windows-update.html">self-host on Windows&lt;/a>. In February 2015, we had the first fallback-free build of 64-bit Chrome, in July 2015 the first fallback-free build of 32-bit Chrome (32-bit SEH was difficult). In Oct 2015, we shipped a first clang-built Chrome to the Canary channel. Since then, we’ve worked on &lt;a href="http://https//crbug.com/457078">improving the size of Clang’s output&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://crbug.com/636111">improved Clang’s debug information&lt;/a> (some of it behind -instcombine-lower-dbg-declare=0 for now), and A/B-tested stability and telemetry performance metrics.&lt;br />&lt;br />We use versions of Clang that are pinned to a recent upstream revision that we update every one to three weeks, without any local patches. All our work is done in upstream LLVM.&lt;br />&lt;br />Mid-2015, Microsoft announced that they were building on top of our work of making Clang able to parse all the Microsoft SDK headers with &lt;a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2015/05/01/bringing-clang-to-windows/">clang/c2&lt;/a>, which used the Clang frontend for parsing code, but cl.exe’s codegen to generate code. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stephantlavavej/status/871861920315211776?lang=en">Development on clang/c2 was halted again&lt;/a> in mid-2017; it is conceivable that this was related to our improvements to MSVC-ABI-compatible Clang codegen quality. We’re thankful to Microsoft for publishing documentation on the PDB file format, answering many of our questions, fixing Clang compatibility issues in their SDKs, and for giving us publicity on their blog! Again, Clang is not a replacement for MSVC, but a complement to it.&lt;br />&lt;br />Opera for Windows is also &lt;a href="http://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2018/02/opera-51/">compiled with Clang&lt;/a> starting in version 51.&lt;br />&lt;br />Firefox is also looking at &lt;a href="https://ehsanakhgari.org/blog/2016-01-29/building-firefox-with-clang-cl-a-status-update">using clang-cl for building Firefox for Windows&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">Next Steps&lt;/h3>Just as clang-cl is a cl.exe-compatible interface for Clang, lld-link is a link.exe-compatible interface for lld, the LLVM linker. Our next step is to use lld-link as an alternative to link.exe for linking Chrome for Windows. This has many of the same advantages as clang-cl (open-source, easy to update, …). Also, using clang-cl together with lld-link allows using &lt;a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.html">LLVM-bitcode-based LTO&lt;/a> (which in turn enables using &lt;a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html">CFI&lt;/a>) and &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2018/01/improving-link-time-on-windows-with.html">using PE/COFF extensions to speed up linking&lt;/a>. A prerequisite for using lld-link was &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2017/08/llvm-on-windows-now-supports-pdb-debug.html">its ability to write PDB files&lt;/a>.&lt;br />We’re also considering using libc++ instead of the MSVC STL – this allows us to instrument the standard library, which is again useful for CFI and Address Sanitizer.&lt;span style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">In Closing&lt;/h3>Thanks to the whole LLVM community for helping to create the first new production C++ compiler for Windows in over a decade, and the first-ever open-source C++ compiler that’s ABI-compatible with MSVC!&lt;br />&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>EuroLLVM'18 developers' meeting program</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2018/03/eurollvm18-developers-meeting-program.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 14:31:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2018/03/eurollvm18-developers-meeting-program.html</guid><description>

We are excited to announce the LLVM project has been accepted to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6471192286855168/">2018 Google Summer of Code&lt;/a>!&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>What is Google Summer of Code?&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />&lt;/b>Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program focused on introducing students to open source software development. Students work on a 3 month programming project with an open source organization during their break from university. There are several benefits to this program for both the students and LLVM:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>Inspire students to get involved with open source, compilers and LLVM&lt;/li>&lt;li>Give students exposure to real-world software development while getting paid a stipend&lt;/li>&lt;li>Allow students to do paid work related to their academic pursuits versus getting an unrelated summer job&lt;/li>&lt;li>Bring new developers into the LLVM project&lt;/li>&lt;li>Some LLVM bugs get fixed or new features get added&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&lt;b>Students - Apply now!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />&lt;/b>Ok, so you can't apply right now as the official application to GSoC does not open until March 12, 2018, but you must begin discussing your project on the &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo">LLVM mailing lists&lt;/a> well before that date. There are many &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/OpenProjects.html#gsoc18">open projects listed on our webpage&lt;/a>. Once you have selected a project, you will discuss it on the appropriate mailing list.&lt;br />&lt;br />If you have an idea for a project that is not listed, you can always propose it on the list as well and seek out a mentor.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Key Dates to Remember&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />&lt;/b>We have listed a few key dates here, but always consult the&lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline">&amp;nbsp;official GSoC timeline&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;to confirm.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>March 12 (16:00 UTC) - Applications open&lt;/li>&lt;li>March 27 (16:00 UTC) - Deadline to file your application&lt;/li>&lt;li>April 23 (16:00 UTC) - Accepted student proposals are announced&lt;/li>&lt;li>May 14 - Coding begins&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />&lt;/b>&lt;b>LLVM Developers - Consider&amp;nbsp;being mentor!&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />&lt;/b>This program is not a success without our mentors. Thank you to all that have all who have already volunteered! If you have never mentored a GSoC project but are curious, it is not too late to volunteer!

One of our goals in bringing clang and lld to Windows has always been to improve developer experience, and what is it that developers want the most?&amp;nbsp; Faster build times!&amp;nbsp; Recently, our focus has been on improving link time because it's the step that's the hardest to parallelize so we can't fall back on the time honored tradition of throwing more cores at it.&lt;br />&lt;br />Of the various steps involved in linking, generating the debug info (which, on Windows, is a PDB file) is by far the slowest since it involves merging O(# of linker inputs) sequences of type records, most of which are duplicate anyway.&amp;nbsp; For example, if two cpp files both include &lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">, then both of those object files will have hundreds of duplicate type records that need to be de-duplicated during the link step.&amp;nbsp; This means you have to compute O(M x N) hash values, even though only a small fraction of those ultimately contribute to the final PDB.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">Several strategies have been invented to deal with this over the years and try to make linking faster.&amp;nbsp; Many years ago, Microsoft introduced the notion of a &lt;i>Type Server&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;(enabled via&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>/Zi&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;compiler option in MSVC), which moves some of the work into the compiler (to take advantage of parallelism).&amp;nbsp; More recently we have been given the &lt;b>/DEBUG:FASTLINK&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;linker option which attempts to solve the problem by not merging types at all in the linker.&amp;nbsp; However, each of these strategies has its own set of disadvantages, and neither can be considered perfect for all use cases.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">In this blog post, we'll first go over some technical background about CodeView so that we can understand the problem, followed by a summary of existing attempts to speed up type merging.&amp;nbsp; Then, we'll describe a novel extension to the PE/COFF file format which speeds up linking by offloading part of the work required to de-duplicate types to the compiler and using a new algorithm which uniquely identifies type records even across input files, and discuss the various tradeoffs of each approach.&amp;nbsp; Finally, we'll present some benchmarks and discuss how you can try this out in clang-cl and lld today.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;h2>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">Background&lt;/span>&lt;/h2>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">Consider a simple structure in C++, defined like this a header file:&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot;

As a result, to guarantee that the type makes it into the final PDB, &lt;i>every&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;compiler instance that encounters this definition must emit type information for this type.&amp;nbsp; So the record will be serialized by the compiler into a series of records that looks roughly like this:&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot;

, &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;">mspdbsrv.exe&lt;/span>) whose job is to de-duplicate type records on the fly, and when a record is isomorphic to an existing record, the type server communicates back the previously saved index, and when it is new it sends back a new index.&amp;nbsp; This allows type deduplication to happen &lt;i>mostly&lt;/i>in parallel, but adding some overhead to each compilation (since there is contention over a global lock) in return for significantly reduced link times, since types will already have been merged.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;span lang="EN">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;span lang="EN">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;span lang="EN">&lt;/span>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;span lang="EN">&lt;span lang="EN">Type servers bring with them some disadvantages though, so we enumerate them here:&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;span lang="EN">&lt;ol start="1" style="margin-top: 0in;" type="1">&lt;li class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&lt;span lang="EN">Type servers add significant context switching and global lock contention to the compilation phase, reducing parallelism and degrading overall system performance while a build is in process.&amp;nbsp;

To support this, special metadata is set in the PDB file to indicate to the tool that this is a fastlink PDB, and when the tool (e.g. debugger) encounters this metadata, it will fetch all type information from the original object file, rather than from the PDB.&amp;nbsp; As before, there are several disadvantages to this approach, enumerated here:&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;ol start="1" style="margin-top: 0in;" type="1">&lt;li class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&lt;span lang="EN">The &lt;/span>&lt;span lang="EN" style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot;;

This leads to degradation in the debugger user experience, since waits which previously happened only at build time now happen at debug-time.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&lt;span lang="EN">Fastlink PDBs are not portable.&amp;nbsp; The PDB references the object files by path, so if you copy the PDB and object files to a different machine (or even different path on the same machine) for archival purposes, they can no longer be debugged.&amp;nbsp; This is a deal-breaker for using it on production builds&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&lt;span lang="EN">Symbols can’t be enumerated in a Fastlink PDB.&amp;nbsp; This is most obvious if you attempt to use DIA SDK on a Fastlink PDB, where it will simply refuse to do anything at all.&amp;nbsp; This means that the only externally supported way of querying debug info for users is impossible against a Fastlink PDB.&amp;nbsp; Beyond that, however, it also means that even Microsoft’s own tools which need to enumerate symbols cannot use any standard API for doing so.&amp;nbsp; For example, WinDbg doesn’t fully support Fastlink PDBs, and many workflows are broken by the use of them, even using supported Microsoft tools.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&lt;span lang="EN">It has several serious stability issues which make it unusable on large projects&amp;nbsp;

This is probably related to point 4 above, namely the fact that every tool that wants to be able to work with a Fastlink PDB needs to use different code than the SDK that has been tested and battle-hardened through years of development.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">&lt;span lang="EN">When compiling with clang-cl and linking with /debug:fastlink the compiler has to be instructed to &lt;a href="https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn?type=cs&amp;amp;q=build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn&amp;amp;sq=package:chromium&amp;amp;l=1886">&lt;span style="color: #1155cc;">emit additional debug information&lt;/span>&lt;/a>, making .obj files about 29% larger.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;div>&lt;h2>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;span lang="EN">Clang's Solution - The COFF &lt;/span>&lt;span lang="EN">.debug$H&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span lang="EN">&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"> section&lt;/span>&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/span>&lt;/h2>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;span lang="EN">This new approach tries to combine the ideas behind type servers and fastlink PDBs.&amp;nbsp; Like type servers, it attempts to offload the work of de-duplication to the compilation phase so that it can be done in parallel.&amp;nbsp; However, it does so using an algorithm with the property that the resulting hash can be used to identify a type record even across type streams.&amp;nbsp;

And since this is happening naturally in the order in which types are encountered, all that has to be done is to save these hash values in an array indexed by type index, and subsequent hash operations will have O(1) access to all of the information needed to compute this merkle hash.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoSubtitle">&lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="_ma3qfmnbo3o6">&lt;/a>&lt;span lang="EN">&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;h3>&lt;span lang="EN">Mixed Input Files and Compiler/Linker Compatibility&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;div class="MsoSubtitle">&lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="_rmj5k0mxyuuq">&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;span lang="EN">A linker must be prepared to deal with a mixed set of input files.&amp;nbsp;

Clang is no exception: it has 447 command-line options. It’s nearly impossible to memorize all these options and their correct spellings, that's where shell completion can be very handy. When you type in the first few characters of a flag and hit tab, it will autocomplete the rest for you.&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-68af261c-84f5-10c3-00b1-6106d33aa46a">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-68af261c-84f5-10c3-00b1-6106d33aa46a">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;; font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Background&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br class="kix-line-break" />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">However, such a autocompletion feature is not available yet, as there's no easy way to get a complete list of the options Clang supports. For example, bash doesn’t have any autocompletion support for Clang, and despite some shells like zsh having a script for command-line autocompletion, they use hard coded lists of command-line options, and are not automatically updated when a new option is added to Clang. These shells also can’t autocomplete arguments which some flags take (-std=[tab] for instance).&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-68af261c-84f5-10c3-00b1-6106d33aa46a">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This is the problem we were working to solve during this year’s Google Summer of Code. We’re adding a feature to Clang so that we can implement a complete, exact command-line option completion which is highly portable for any shell. To start with, we'll provide a completion script for bash which uses this feature. &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-68af261c-84f5-10c3-00b1-6106d33aa46a">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-68af261c-84f5-10c3-00b1-6106d33aa46a">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;; font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Implementation&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-68af261c-84f5-10c3-00b1-6106d33aa46a">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Clang now has a new command line option called &lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">--autocomplete&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. This flag receives the incomplete user input from the shell and then queries the internal data structures of the current Clang binary, and returns a list of possible completions.

For various reasons, other debuggers developed an independent format called DWARF, which eventually became standardized and is now widely supported by many compilers and programming languages. &amp;nbsp;CodeView, like DWARF, defines a set of records that describe mappings between source lines and code addresses, as well as types and symbols that your program uses. &amp;nbsp;The debugger then uses this information to let you set breakpoints by function name, display the value of a variable, etc. &amp;nbsp;But CodeView is only somewhat documented, with the &lt;/span>&lt;a href="http://ftp.openwatcom.org/devel/docs/CodeView.pdf" style="text-decoration: none;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent;

margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It’s important to understand though that CodeView is just a collection of records. &amp;nbsp;What happens when the user says “&lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;; font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">show me the value of Foo&lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent;

analyze crash dumps. &amp;nbsp;Debugging with PDB is extremely responsive given that the debugger does not have to index symbols upon startup, since the indices are built into the file format. &amp;nbsp;And last but not least, tools such as WinDbg are already great for post-mortem debugging, and frankly many (perhaps even most) Windows developers will only give up the Visual Studio debugger when it is pried from their cold dead hands.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;b style="font-weight: normal;">&lt;br />&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38;

Compilation proceeds one translation unit at a time, so, barring LTO, there are only a few cases when the compiler may conclude that there are no overrides:&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">either the class or virtual method is marked as final&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">the class is defined in an anonymous namespace and has no deriving classes in its translation unit&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt;">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif;">The latter is more tricky for clang, which translates the source code in chunks on the fly (see: ASTProducer and ASTConsumer), so is not able to determine if there are any deriving classes later in the source. This could be dealt with in a couple of ways:&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif;">give up immediate generation&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">run data flow analysis in LLVM to find all the dynamic types passed to function, which has static linkage&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; white-space: pre-wrap;">hope that every use of the virtual function, which is necessarily in the same translation unit, will be inlined by LLVM -- static linkage increases the chances of inlining&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large; white-space: pre-wrap;">Store to load propagation in LLVM&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif;">&lt;span style="text-align: justify; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; text-align: justify; white-space: pre-wrap;">In order to devirtualize a virtual call we need:&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; text-align: justify; white-space: pre-wrap;">value of vptr - which virtual table is pointed by it&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; text-align: justify; white-space: pre-wrap;">value of vtable slot - which exact virtual function it is&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; text-align: justify; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; text-align: justify; white-space: pre-wrap;">Because vtables are constant, the latter value is much easier to get when we have the value of vptr.

Because queries might be performed for each instruction we end up with a quadratic algorithm. Of course quadratic algorithms are not welcome in compilers, so MemDep can only check certain number of instructions.&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif;">&lt;span style="vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Memory SSA on the other hand has constant complexity because of caching. To find out more, watch “Memory SSA in 5minutes” (&lt;/span>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdxWmryoHak" style="text-decoration: none;">&lt;span style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdxWmryoHak&lt;/span>&lt;/a>&lt;span style="vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">). MemSSA is a pretty new analysis and it doesn’t have all the features MemDep has, therefore MemDep is still widely used.&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;/div>&lt;span style="text-align: justify; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif;">The LLVM main pass that does store to load propagation is GVN - Global Value Numbering. &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large; white-space: pre-wrap;">Finding vptr store&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif;">&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-position: normal; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif;">&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;span style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In order to figure out the vptr value, we need to see store from constructor.

In other words, optimizer will have to assume that vfunction might change the vptr in passed object. This sounds like something that never happens because vptr is “const”. The truth is that it is actually weaker than C++ const member, because it changes multiple times during construction of an object (every base type constructor or destructor must set vptrs). But vptr can't be changed during a virtual call, right?

So, by constructing a Derived object in the place where an object of type A was living, we change the vptr to point to Derived’s vtable. Is this code even legal? C++ Standard says yes.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: small; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="display: inline !important; line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: small;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">However it turns out that if someone called &lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">foo&lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> 2 times (with the same object), the second call would be undefined behavior. Standard pretty much says that call or dereference of a pointer to an object whose lifetime has ended is UB, and because the standard agrees that nuking object from inside ends its lifetime, the second call is UB. Be aware that this is only because a zombie pointer is used for the second call. The pointer returned by placement new is considered alive, so performing calls on that pointer is valid. Note that we also silently used that fact with the use of assume.&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large; white-space: pre-wrap;">(un)clobbering vptr&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;/h2>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif;">&lt;span style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">We need to somehow say that vptr is invariant during its lifetime. We decided to introduce a new metadata for that purpose - !invariant.group. &lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: white; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The presence of the invariant.group metadata on the load/store tells the optimizer that every load and store to the same pointer operand within the same invariant group can be assumed to load or store the same value.

It returns another pointer that aliases its argument but is considered different for the purposes of load/store invariant.group metadata. Optimizer won’t be able to figure out that returned pointer is the same because intrinsics don’t have a definition. Barrier must be inserted in all the places where the dynamic object changes:&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; text-align: justify; white-space: pre-wrap;">constructors&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; text-align: justify; white-space: pre-wrap;">destructors&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; text-align: justify; white-space: pre-wrap;">placement new of dynamic object&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large;">&lt;span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large; white-space: pre-wrap;">Dealing with barriers&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="text-align: justify; white-space: pre-wrap;">Barriers hinder some other optimizations.

Currently it is done before codegen. The problem is that most of the devirtualization comes from GVN, which also does most of the optimizations we would miss with barriers. GVN is expensive therefore it is run only once. It also might make less sense if we are in LTO mode, because that would limit the devirtualization in the link phase.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; text-align: justify; white-space: pre-wrap;">teaching important passes to look through the barrier. This might be very tricky to preserve the semantics of barrier, but e.g. looking for dependency of load without invariant.group by jumping through the barrier to find a store without invariant.group, is likely to do the trick.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; text-align: justify; white-space: pre-wrap;">removing invariant.barrier when its argument comes from alloca and is never used etc.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif;">&lt;span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">To find out more details about devirtualization check my talk (&lt;/span>&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2016-11/#talk6" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">http://llvm.org/devmtg/2016-11/#talk6&lt;/a>&lt;span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">) from LLVM Dev Meeting 2016.&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif;">&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #434343; font-weight: 400; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large;">About author&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;h2>&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;">&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Undergraduate student at University of Warsaw, currently working on C++ static analysis in IIIT.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot;; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;/span>&lt;/h2>&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Some news about apt.llvm.org</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2017/03/some-news-about-aptllvmorg.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2017 12:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2017/03/some-news-about-aptllvmorg.html</guid><description>
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&lt;a href="http://apt.llvm.org/">apt.llvm.org&lt;/a> provides Debian and Ubuntu repositories for every maintained version of these distributions. LLVM, Clang, clang extra tools, compiler-rt, polly, LLDB and LLD packages are generated for the stable, stabilization and development branches.&lt;br />&lt;br />As it seems that we have more and more users of these packages, I would like to share an update about various recent changes.&lt;br />&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">New features&lt;/h3>&lt;h4 style="text-align: left;">LLD&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;">First, the cool new stuff : lld is now proposed and built for i386/amd64 on all Debian and Ubuntu supported versions. The test suite is also executed and the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/reports/coverage/">coverage results&lt;/a> are great. &lt;/span>&lt;/h4>&lt;h4 style="text-align: left;">4.0&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;">Then, following the branching for the 4.0 release, I created new repositories to propose this release.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;">For example, for Debian stable, just add the following in &lt;i>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/llvm.list&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/h4>&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;i>&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;">deb http://apt.llvm.org/jessie/ llvm-toolchain-jessie-4.0 main&lt;/span>&lt;/i>&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;">&lt;i>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp; deb-src http://apt.llvm.org/jessie/ llvm-toolchain-jessie main&lt;/i>&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>&lt;br />&lt;h4 style="text-align: left;">llvm-defaults&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;">Obviously, the trunk is now 5.0. If llvm-defaults is used, clang, lldb and other meta packages will be automatically updated to this version.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;">As a consequence and also because the branches are dead, 3.7 and 3.8 jobs have been disabled. Please note that both repositories are still available on apt.llvm.org and won't be removed.&lt;/span>&lt;/h4>&lt;h4 style="text-align: left;">Zesty: New Ubuntu&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;">Packages for the next Ubuntu 17.04 (zesty) are also generated for 3.9, 4.0 and 5.0.&lt;/span>&lt;/h4>&lt;h4 style="text-align: left;">libfuzzer&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;">It has been implemented a few months ago but not clearly communicated. &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html">libfuzzer&lt;/a> has also its own packages: libfuzzer-X.Y-dev (example: &lt;i>libfuzzer-3.9-dev,&lt;/i> &lt;i>libfuzzer-4.0-dev&lt;/i> or &lt;i>libfuzzer-5.0-dev&lt;/i>).&lt;/span>&lt;/h4>&lt;br />&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">Changes in the infrastructure&lt;/h3>&lt;br />In order to support the load, I started to use new blades that Google (thanks again to Nick Lewycky) sponsored for an initiative that I was running for Debian and &lt;a href="https://www.irill.org/">IRILL&lt;/a>. The 6 new blades removed all the wait time. With a new salt configuration, I automated the deployment of the slaves. In case the load increases again, we will have access to more blades.&lt;br />&lt;br />I also took the time to fix some long ongoing issues:&lt;br />&lt;ul style="text-align: left;">&lt;li>all repositories are signed and verified that they are&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;i>i386&lt;/i> and &lt;i>amd64&lt;/i> packages are now uploaded at once instead of being uploaded separately. This was causing checksum error when one of the two architectures built correctly and the second was failing (ex: test failing)&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Last but not least, the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/reports/coverage/">code coverage results&lt;/a> are produced in a more reliable manner.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h3>More information about the implementation and services.&lt;/h3>As what is shipped on apt.llvm.org is exactly the same as in Debian and Ubuntu, packaging files are stored on the &lt;a href="https://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-llvm/llvm-toolchain/branches/">Debian subversion server.&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;br />A &lt;a href="http://llvm-jenkins.debian.net/">Jenkins instance&lt;/a> is in charge of the orchestration of the whole build infrastructure.&lt;br />&lt;br />The trunk packages are built twice a day for every Debian and Ubuntu packages. Branches (3.9 and 4.0 currently) are rebuilt only when the - trigger job found a change. &lt;br />&lt;br />In both case, the Jenkins source job will checkout the Debian SVN branches for their version, checkout/update LLVM/clang/etc repositories and repack everything to create the source tarballs and Debian files (dsc, etc).The completion of job will trigger the binaries job to start. These jobs, thanks to &lt;a href="https://jenkins-debian-glue.org/">Debian Jenkins glue&lt;/a> will create or update Debian/Ubuntu versions.&lt;br />&lt;br />Then builds are done the usual way through pbuilder for both i386 and amd64. All the test suites are going to be executed. If any LLVM test is failing on i386 or amd64, the whole build will fail. If both builds and the LLVM testsuite are successful, the sync job will start and rsync packages to the LLVM server to be replicated on the CDN. If one or both builds fail, a notification is sent to the administrator.&lt;br />&lt;br />Some Debian static analysis (&lt;a href="https://packages.debian.org/stretch/lintian">lintian&lt;/a>) are executed on the packages to prevent some packaging errors. From time to time, some interesting issues are found.&lt;br />&lt;br />In parallel, some binary builds have some special hooks like &lt;a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/llvm">Coverity&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/reports/coverage/">code coverage&lt;/a> or installation of more recent versions of gcc for Ubuntu precise.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">Report bugs&lt;/h3>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;">Bugs can be reported on the &lt;a href="https://bugs.llvm.org//enter_bug.cgi?product=Packaging&amp;amp;component=deb%20packages">bugzilla of the LLVM project&lt;/a> in the product "Packaging" and the component "deb packages".&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;">&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">Common issues&lt;/h3>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">Because packaging quickly moving projects like LLVM or clang, in some cases, this can be challenging to follow the rhythm in particular with regard to tests. For Debian unstable or the latest version of Ubuntu, the matrix is complexified by new versions of the basic pieces of the operating system like gcc/g++ or libtstdc++.&lt;br />&lt;br />This is also not uncommon that some tests are being ignored in the process.&lt;/div>&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">How to help&lt;/h3>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">&lt;br />Some &lt;a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?include=originator%3Asylvestre;tag=newcomer">new comers bugs&lt;/a> are available. As an example:&lt;br />&lt;ul style="text-align: left;">&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=751789">Move the compiler-rt libraries&lt;/a> into a specific packages to simplify their usage by other packages &lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=813673">Ship libc++&lt;/a> as part of llvm-toolchain packages&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=813672">Ship openmp library&lt;/a> as part of llvm-toolchain packages&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=827185">Full bootstrap of llvm-toolchain&lt;/a> (use a clang built during the process)&lt;/li>&lt;li>... &lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Related to all this, a Google Summer of Code 2017 under the LLVM umbrella has been proposed: &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/OpenProjects.html#apt">Integrate libc++ and OpenMP in apt.llvm.org&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;br />Help is also needed to keep track of the new test failures and get them fixed upstream. For example, a few tests have been marked as &lt;i>expected to fail&lt;/i> to avoid crashes.&lt;/div>&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>2016 LLVM Developers' Meeting - Experience from Johannes Doerfert, Travel Grant Recipient</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2017/02/this-blog-post-is-part-of-series-of.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2017 23:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2017/02/this-blog-post-is-part-of-series-of.html</guid><description>

This year&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">however my roles were different. First, I was attending as part of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">organization team of the European LLVM developers meeting 2017 [0]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">together with my colleagues Tina Jung and Simon Moll. In this capacity I&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">answered questions about the venue (Saarbruecken, Germany [1,2]) and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">alterations in contrast to prior meetings. Though, more importantly, I&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">advertised the meeting to core developers that usually do not attend the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">European version. Second on my agenda was the BoF on a parallel&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">extension to the LLVM-IR which I organized with Simon Moll. In this BoF,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">but also during the preparation discussion on the mailing list [3], we&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">tried to collect motivating examples, requirements as well as known&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">challenges for a parallel extension to LLVM. These insights will be used&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">to draft a proposal that can be discussed in the community.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">Finally, I attended as a 4th year PhD student who is interested in&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">contributing his work to the LLVM project (not only Polly). As my c&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">urrent research required a flexible polyhedral value (and iteration&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">space) analysis, I used the opportunity to implement one with an&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">interface similar to scalar evolution. The feedback I received on this&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">topic was strictly positive. I will soon post a first version of this&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">standalone analysis and start a public discussion. Since I hope to&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">finish my studies at some (not too distant) point in time, I seized the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">opportunity to inquire about potential options for the time after my&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">PhD.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;" />&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">As a final note I would like to thank the LLVM Foundation for their&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">student travel grant that allowed me to attend the meeting in the first&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">place.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;" />&lt;br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;" />&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">[0]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2017-03/" style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">http://llvm.org/devmtg/2017-03/&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">[1]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;a href="http://sic.saarland/" style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">http://sic.saarland/&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">[2]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saarbr%C3%BCcken" style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saarbr%C3%BCcken&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">[3]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-October/106051.html" style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-October/106051.html&lt;/a></description></item><item><title>LLVM's New Versioning Scheme</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/12/llvms-new-versioning-scheme.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2016 13:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/12/llvms-new-versioning-scheme.html</guid><description>
Historically, LLVM's major releases always added "0.1" to the version number, producing major versions like 3.8, 3.9, and 4.0 (expected by March 2017). With our next release though, we're changing this. &amp;nbsp;The LLVM version number will now increase by "1.0" with every major release, which means that the first major release after LLVM 4.0 will be LLVM 5.0 (expected September 2017).&lt;br />We believe that this approach will provide a simpler and more standard approach to versioning.&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>LLVM’s version number (also shared by many of its sub-projects, such as Clang, LLD, etc.) consists of three parts: &lt;i>major&lt;/i>.&lt;i>minor&lt;/i>.&lt;i>patch&lt;/i>. The community produces a new release every six months, with "patch" releases (also known as "dot" or "stable" releases) containing bug fixes in between.&lt;br />Until now, the six-monthly releases would cause the &lt;i>minor&lt;/i> component of the version to be incremented. Every five years, after &lt;i>minor&lt;/i> reached 9, a more major release would occur, including some breaking changes: &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-announce/2007-May/000023.html">2.0&lt;/a> introduced the bitcode format, &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-announce/2011-December/000039.html">3.0&lt;/a> a &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2011/11/llvm-30-type-system-rewrite.html">type system rewrite&lt;/a>.&lt;br />During &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-June/101044.html">the discussions&lt;/a> about what to call the release after 3.9, it was pointed out that since our releases are time-based rather than feature-based, the distinction between major and minor releases seems arbitrary. Further, every release is also API breaking, so by the principles of &lt;a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning&lt;/a>, we should be incrementing the major version number.&lt;br />We decided that going forward, &lt;b>every release on the six-month cycle will be a major release&lt;/b>. Patch releases will increment the &lt;i>patch&lt;/i> component as before (producing versions like 5.0.1), and the &lt;i>minor&lt;/i> component will stay at zero since no minor releases will be made.&lt;br />&lt;h3>Bitcode Compatibility&lt;/h3>Before LLVM 4.0.0, the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html">Developer Policy&lt;/a> specified that bitcode produced by LLVM would be readable by the next versions up to and including the next major release. The new version of the Developer Policy instead specifies that LLVM will currently load any bitcode produced by version 3.0 or later. When developers decide to drop support for some old bitcode feature, the policy will be updated.&lt;br />&lt;h3>API Compatibility&lt;/h3>Nothing has changed. As before, patch releases are API and ABI compatible with the main releases, and the C API is "&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#c-api-changes">best effort&lt;/a>" for stability, but besides that, LLVM’s API changes between releases. &lt;br />&lt;h3>What About the Minor Version?&lt;/h3>Since the &lt;i>minor&lt;/i> version is expected to always be zero, why not drop it and just use &lt;i>major&lt;/i>.&lt;i>patch&lt;/i> as the version number?&lt;br />Dropping the minor component from the middle of the version string would introduce ambiguity: whether to interpret &lt;i>x&lt;/i>.&lt;i>y&lt;/i> as &lt;i>major&lt;/i>.&lt;i>minor&lt;/i> or &lt;i>major&lt;/i>.&lt;i>patch&lt;/i> would then depend on the value of &lt;i>x&lt;/i>.&lt;br />The version numbers are also exposed through various APIs, such as LLVM's &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">llvm-config.h&lt;/span> and Clang's &lt;span style="font-family: monospace;">__clang_minor__&lt;/span> preprocessor macro. Removing the &lt;i>minor&lt;/i> component from these APIs would break a lot of existing code.&lt;br />Going forward, since the &lt;i>minor&lt;/i> number will be zero and patch releases are compatible, I expect we will generally refer to versions simply by their &lt;i>major&lt;/i> number and treat the rest of the version string as details (just as Chromium 55 might really be 55.0.2883.76). Future versions of LLVM and Clang can generally be referred to simply as "LLVM 4" or "Clang 5".</description></item><item><title>Announcing the next LLVM Foundation Board of Directors</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2016-09-12-announcing-next-llvm-foundation-board.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2016 09:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2016-09-12-announcing-next-llvm-foundation-board.html</guid><description>

&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&lt;div style="text-align: left;">ThinLTO was first introduced at &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2015-04/slides/ThinLTO_EuroLLVM2015.pdf">EuroLLVM in 2015&lt;/a>, with results shown from a prototype implementation within clang and LLVM. Since then, the design was reviewed through several RFCs, it has been implemented in LLVM (for gold and libLTO), and tuning is ongoing. Results already show good performance for a number of benchmarks, with compile time close to a non-LTO build.&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">This blog post covers the background, design, current status and usage information.&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">This post was written by Teresa Johnson, Mehdi Amini and David Li.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;h3>LTO Background and Motivation&lt;/h3>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">LTO (Link Time Optimization) is a method for achieving better runtime performance through whole-program analysis and cross-module optimization. During the compile phase, clang will emit LLVM bitcode &amp;nbsp;instead of an object file. The linker recognizes these bitcode files and invokes LLVM during the link to generate the final objects that will constitute the executable. The LLVM implementation loads all input bitcode files and merges them together to produce a single Module. The interprocedural analyses (IPA) as well as the interprocedural optimizations (IPO) are performed serially on this monolithic Module.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/--p7jPdTVaxI/V19BygsO0aI/AAAAAAAAMhg/aJSiVLqd30AFDXPyQqZkQFaKPohsfNHwgCKgB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-13%2Bat%2B4.28.25%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="292" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/--p7jPdTVaxI/V19BygsO0aI/AAAAAAAAMhg/aJSiVLqd30AFDXPyQqZkQFaKPohsfNHwgCKgB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-13%2Bat%2B4.28.25%2BPM.png" width="640" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">What this means in practice is that LTO often requires a large amount of memory (to hold all IR at once) and is very slow. And with debug information enabled via -g, the size of the IR and the resulting memory requirements are significantly larger. Even without debug information, this is prohibitive for very large applications, or when compiling on memory-constrained machines. It also makes incremental builds less effective, as everything from the LTO step on must be re-executed when any input source changes.&lt;/div>&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">ThinLTO Design&lt;/h3>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">ThinLTO is a new approach that is designed to scale like a non-LTO build, while retaining most of the performance achievement of full LTO.&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">In ThinLTO, the serial step is very thin and fast. This is because instead of loading the bitcode and merging a single monolithic module to perform these analyses, it utilizes compact summaries of each module for global analyses in the serial link step, as well as an index of function locations for later cross module importing. The function importing and other IPO transformations are performed later when the modules are optimized in fully parallel backends.&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">The key transformation enabled by ThinLTO global analyses is function importing, in which only those functions likely to be inlined are imported into each module. This minimizes the memory overhead in each ThinLTO backend, while maximizing the most impactful cross module optimization opportunities. The IPO transformations are therefore performed on each module extended with its imported functions.&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">The ThinLTO process is divided into 3 phases:&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">&lt;ol style="text-align: left;">&lt;li>Compile: Generate IR as with full LTO mode, but extended with module summaries&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>&lt;li>Thin Link: Thin linker plugin layer to combine summaries and perform global analyses&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>&lt;li>ThinLTO backend: Parallel backends with summary-based importing and optimizations&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n15XLWlQoJE/V18v5zSXCGI/AAAAAAAAMgc/5utJmweTI8QoqCbfruf-LHLHyY7ij-UVgCKgB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-13%2Bat%2B3.12.16%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="274" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n15XLWlQoJE/V18v5zSXCGI/AAAAAAAAMgc/5utJmweTI8QoqCbfruf-LHLHyY7ij-UVgCKgB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-13%2Bat%2B3.12.16%2BPM.png" width="640" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">By default, linkers that support ThinLTO (see below) are set up to launch the ThinLTO backends in threads. So the distinction between the second and third phases is transparent to the user.&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">The key enabler for this process are the summaries emitted during phase 1. These summaries are emitted using the bitcode format, but designed so that they can be separately loaded without involving an LLVMContext or any other expensive construction. Each global variable and function has an entry in the module summary. An entry contains metadata that abstracts the symbol it is describing. For example, a function is abstracted with its linkage type, the number of instructions it contains, and optional profiling information (PGO). Additionally, every reference (address taken, direct call) to another global is recorded. This information enables building a complete reference graph during the Thin Link phase, and subsequent fast analyses using the global summary information.&lt;/div>&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">Current Status&lt;/h3>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">ThinLTO is currently supported in both the gold plugin as well as in ld64 starting with &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode 8&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp;Additionally, support is currently being added to the lld linker. The 3.9 release of clang will have ThinLTO accessible using the -flto=thin command line option.&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">While tuning is still in progress, ThinLTO already performs well compared to LTO, in many cases matching the performance improvement. In a few cases ThinLTO even outperforms full LTO, most likely because the higher scalability of ThinLTO allows using a more aggressive backend optimization pipeline (similar to that of a non-LTO build).&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">The following results were collected for the C/C++ SPEC cpu2006 benchmarks on an 8-core 2.6GHz Intel Xeon E5-2689. Each benchmark was run in isolation three times and results are shown for the average of the three runs.&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FBz172vtE5q1NtGldLhWM11Q_S0CxXO8gTtEUMFTHEWhq5H6vO9ouh8HxMo_46rAaONS_WCz4G1zgUli_6sm6EeQJaMOg8lxfc3L7WQNhLMKyb9tvpi1qEPVMsJ4u3_1zL0v-mBk" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="453" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FBz172vtE5q1NtGldLhWM11Q_S0CxXO8gTtEUMFTHEWhq5H6vO9ouh8HxMo_46rAaONS_WCz4G1zgUli_6sm6EeQJaMOg8lxfc3L7WQNhLMKyb9tvpi1qEPVMsJ4u3_1zL0v-mBk" width="640" />&lt;/a>&lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=6088150582281556517" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">Critically, due to the scalable design of ThinLTO, this performance is achieved with a build time that stays within a non-LTO build scale. The following build times were collected on a 20 core 2.8GHz Intel Xeon CPU E5-2680 v2, running Linux and using the gold linker. The results are for an end-to-end build of clang (ninja clang) from a clean build directory, so it includes all the compile steps and links of intermediate binaries such as llvm-tblgen and clang-tblgen.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iLPTCAEC8yU/V1jubF7sl9I/AAAAAAAAMfQ/sRVEnIRxebc80PorKWB5lqRGD6G1OlGDACKgB/s1600/BuildTime.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="394" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iLPTCAEC8yU/V1jubF7sl9I/AAAAAAAAMfQ/sRVEnIRxebc80PorKWB5lqRGD6G1OlGDACKgB/s640/BuildTime.png" width="640" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;br />Release build shows how ThinLTO build time is very comparable to a non-LTO build. Adding -gline-tables-only adds a very small overhead, and ThinLTO is again similar to the regular non-LTO build. However with full debug information, ThinLTO is still somewhat slower than a non-LTO build due to the additional overhead during importing. Ongoing improvements to debug metadata representation and handling are expected to continue to reduce this overhead. In all cases, full LTO is actually significantly slower.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">On the memory consumption side, the improvements are significant. Over the last two years, FullLTO was significantly improved, as shown on the chart below, but our measurement shows that ThinLTO keeps a large advantage.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-22OhulY_7AI/V185N9fAJyI/AAAAAAAAMhE/nBEjhKGbeAcpv_VDj18q_24vwiOQPUMtgCKgB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-13%2Bat%2B3.52.10%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="406" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-22OhulY_7AI/V185N9fAJyI/AAAAAAAAMhE/nBEjhKGbeAcpv_VDj18q_24vwiOQPUMtgCKgB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-13%2Bat%2B3.52.10%2BPM.png" width="640" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">Usage Information&lt;/h3>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">To utilize ThinLTO, simply add the -flto=thin option to compile and link. E.g.&lt;/div>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; % clang -flto=thin -O2 file1.c file2.c -c&lt;br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; % clang -flto=thin -O2 file1.o file2.o -o a.out&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">As mentioned earlier, by default the linkers will launch the ThinLTO backend threads in parallel, passing the resulting native object files back to the linker for the final native link. &amp;nbsp;As such, the usage model the same as non- LTO. Similar to regular LTO, for Linux this requires using the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/GoldPlugin.html">gold linker configured with plugins enabled&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;ld64 starting with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode 8&lt;/a>.&lt;/div>&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">Distributed Build Support&lt;/h3>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">To take advantage of a distributed build system, the parallel ThinLTO backends can each be launched as a separate process. To support this, the gold plugin provides a thinlto_index_only option that causes the link to exit after creating the combined index and performing global analysis.&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">Additionally, in this mode:&lt;/div>&lt;ul style="text-align: left;">&lt;li>Instead of using a monolithic combined index, a separate individual index file is written per backend containing the necessary portions of the combined index for recording the imports and any other global summary based optimization decisions that should be acted on in the backend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>&lt;li>A plain text listing of the bitcode files each module will import from is optionally emitted to aid in distributed build file staging (thinlto-emit-imports-files plugin option).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">The backends can be launched by invoking clang on the bitcode and providing its index via an option. Finally, the resulting native objects are linked to generate the final binary. For example:&lt;/div>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; % clang -flto=thin -O2 file1.c file2.c -c&lt;br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; % clang -flto=thin -O2 file1.o file2.o -Wl,-plugin-opt,-thinlto-index-only&lt;br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; % clang -O2 -o file1.native.o -x ir file1.o -c -fthinlto-index=./file1.o.thinlto.bc&lt;br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; % clang -O2 -o file2.native.o -x ir file2.o -c -fthinlto-index=./file2.o.thinlto.bc&lt;br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; % clang file1.native.o file2.native.o -o a.out&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">Incremental ThinLTO Support&lt;/h3>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">With full LTO, only the initial compile steps can be performed incrementally. If any input has changed, the expensive serial IPA/IPO step must be redone.&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">With ThinLTO, the serial Thin Link step must be redone if any input has changed, however, as noted earlier this is small and fast, and does not involve loading any module. And any particular ThinLTO backend must be redone iff:&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;ol style="text-align: left;">&lt;li>The corresponding (primary) module’s bitcode changed&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>&lt;li>The list of imports into or exports from the module changed&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>&lt;li>The bitcode for any module being imported from has changed&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>&lt;li>Any global analysis result affecting either the primary module or anything it imports has changed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">For single machine builds, where the threads are launched by the linker, incremental builds can be achieved by caching the module after applying the global summary based optimizations such as importing, using a hash of the information listed above as the key. This caching is already supported in libLTO’s ThinLTO handling, which is used by ld64. To enable it, the link step needs to be passed an extra flag: &lt;i>-Wl,-cache_path_lto,/path/to/cache&lt;/i>&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div style="text-align: left;">For distributed builds, the above information in items 2-4 are all serialized into the individual index files. So the build system can compare the contents of the input bitcode files (the primary module’s bitcode and any it imports from) along with the combined index against those from an earlier build to decide if a particular ThinLTO backend must be redone. To make this process more efficient, the content of the bitcode file is hashed when emitted during the compile phase, and the result is stored in the bitcode file itself so that the cache can be queried during the Thin Link step without reading the IR.&lt;br />&lt;br />The chart below illustrates the full build time of clang in three different situations:&lt;br />&lt;ol style="text-align: left;">&lt;li>The full link following a clean build.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The developer fixes the implementation of &lt;i>DenseMap::grow()&lt;/i>. This is a widely used header in the project, which forces to rebuild a large number of files.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The developer fixes the implementation of &lt;i>visitCallInst()&lt;/i> in &lt;i>InstCombineCalls.cpp&lt;/i>. This an implementation file and incremental build should be fast.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1AXpVE8BMtA/V1866_hMEpI/AAAAAAAAMhQ/oBNi7TXF8BcRZD93OUMGJmFa0oFxg3BwwCKgB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-13%2Bat%2B3.59.16%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="358" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1AXpVE8BMtA/V1866_hMEpI/AAAAAAAAMhQ/oBNi7TXF8BcRZD93OUMGJmFa0oFxg3BwwCKgB/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-06-13%2Bat%2B3.59.16%2BPM.png" width="640" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">These results illustrate how full LTO is not friendly with incremental build, and show how ThinLTO is providing an incremental link-time very close to a non-LTO build.&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #129, Jun 20th 2016</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/06/llvm-weekly-129-jun-20th-2016.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2016 04:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/06/llvm-weekly-129-jun-20th-2016.html</guid><description>

&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">In the past year, LNT has grown a number of new features that makes performance tracking and understanding the root causes of performance deltas a lot easier. In this post, I’m showing how we’re using these features.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">LNT contains 2 big pieces of functionality:&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">A server,&lt;br />a. to which you can submit correctness and performance measurement data, by sending it a json-file in the correct format,&lt;br />b. that analyzes which performance changes are significant and which ones aren't,&lt;br />c. that has a webui to show results and analyses in a number of different ways.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">A command line tool to run tests and benchmarks, such as LLVM’s test-suite, SPEC2000 and SPEC2006 benchmarks.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">This post focuses on using the server. None of the features I’ll show are LLVM-specific, or even specific to ahead-of-time code generators, so you should be able to use LNT in the same way for all your code performance tracking needs. At the end, I’ll give pointers to the documentation needed to setup an LNT server and how to construct the json file format with benchmarking and profiling data to be submitted to the server.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">The features highlighted focus on tracking the performance of code, not on other aspects LNT can track and analyze.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">We have 2 main uses cases in tracking performance:&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">Post-commit detection of performance regressions and improvements.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">Pre-commit analysis of the impact of a patch on performance.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">I'll focus on the post-commit detection use case.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;h2>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">Post-commit performance tracking&lt;/span>&lt;/h2>&lt;h4>Step 1. Get an overview of the "Daily Report" page&lt;/h4>&lt;div>&lt;div>Assuming your server runs at http://yourlntserver:8000, this page is located at http://yourlntserver:8000/db_default/v4/nts/daily_report&lt;/div>&lt;div>The page gives a summary of the significant changes it found today.&lt;/div>&lt;div>An example of the kind of view you can get on that page is the following&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lNSURt-I4tc/V2F48OowcSI/AAAAAAAAFg8/EYJXuOe9tZ4_ljn2fzbEjcdTArs0BAeDACLcB/s1600/lnt_daily_report.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="256" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lNSURt-I4tc/V2F48OowcSI/AAAAAAAAFg8/EYJXuOe9tZ4_ljn2fzbEjcdTArs0BAeDACLcB/s640/lnt_daily_report.png" width="640" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;">In the above screenshot, you can see that there were performance differences on 3 different programs, bigfib, fasta and ffbench. The improvement on ffbench only shows up on a machine named “machine3”, whereas the performance regression on the other 2 programs shows up on multiple machines.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;">The table shows how performance evolved over the past 7 days, one column for each day. The sparkline on the right shows graphically how performance has evolved over those days. When the program was run multiple times to get multiple sample points, these show as separate dots that are vertically aligned (because they happened on the same date). The background color in the sparkline represents a hash of the program binary. If the color is the same on multiple days, the binaries were identical on those days.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;">Let’s look first at the ffbench program. The background color in the sparkline is the same for the last 2 days, so the binary for this program didn’t change in those 2 days. Conclusion: the reported performance variation of -8.23% is caused by noise on the machine, not due to a change in code. The vertically spread out dots also indicate that this program has been noisy consistently over the past 7 days.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;">Let’s now look at the bigfib. The background color in the sparkline has changed since its previous run, so let’s investigate further. By clicking on one of the machine names in the table, we go to a chart showing the long-term evolution of the performance of this program on that machine.&lt;/div>&lt;h4>Step 2. The long-term performance evolution chart&lt;/h4>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S53qGJAhZiI/V2F58jQ0NVI/AAAAAAAAFhI/XuxqfUnh0rshfgqD1Gcn1SEynH22ZOEKACLcB/s1600/longterm-perf-evolution-chart.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S53qGJAhZiI/V2F58jQ0NVI/AAAAAAAAFhI/XuxqfUnh0rshfgqD1Gcn1SEynH22ZOEKACLcB/s640/longterm-perf-evolution-chart.png" width="640" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;">This view shows how performance has evolved for this program since we started measuring it. When you click on one of the dots, which each represent a single execution of the program, you get a pop-up with information such as revision, date at which this was run etc.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;">When you click on the number after “Run:” in that pop-up, it’ll bring you to the run page.&lt;/div>&lt;h4 style="clear: both;">Step 3. The Run page&lt;/h4>&lt;div>&lt;div>The run page gives an overview of a full “Run” on a given machine. Exactly what a Run contains depends a bit on how you organize the data, but typically it consists of many programs being run a few times on 1 machine, representing the quality of the code generated by a specific revision of the compiler on one machine, for one optimization level.&lt;/div>&lt;div>This run page shows a lot of information, including performance changes seen since the previous run:&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2CaZGoSAmL4/V2F7Fftk8XI/AAAAAAAAFhU/gnTa49e6lt0ckVLkj49zP20in0VvXd5HACLcB/s1600/run-over-run%2Bchanges.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="128" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2CaZGoSAmL4/V2F7Fftk8XI/AAAAAAAAFhU/gnTa49e6lt0ckVLkj49zP20in0VvXd5HACLcB/s640/run-over-run%2Bchanges.png" width="640" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;div>When hovering with the mouse over entries, a “Profile” button will show, that when clicked, shows profiles of both the previous run and the current run.&lt;/div>&lt;h4>Step 4. The Profile page&lt;/h4>&lt;div>&lt;div>At the top, the page gives you an overview of differences of recorded performance events between the current and previous run.&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1KaKjIGohZw/V2F9WxfRdII/AAAAAAAAFhg/d1ePCRy_uL4T6rVQnZPk316H8iuxutQ0wCLcB/s1600/PerformanceCounters.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="64" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1KaKjIGohZw/V2F9WxfRdII/AAAAAAAAFhg/d1ePCRy_uL4T6rVQnZPk316H8iuxutQ0wCLcB/s640/PerformanceCounters.png" width="640" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">After selecting which function you want to compare, this page shows you the annotated assembly:&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-k5mJCSu02Og/V2F90A9uiSI/AAAAAAAAFho/epjri2UOIPMYQILotrAX34gllJWoSBMSwCLcB/s1600/profile_view.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="306" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-k5mJCSu02Og/V2F90A9uiSI/AAAAAAAAFho/epjri2UOIPMYQILotrAX34gllJWoSBMSwCLcB/s640/profile_view.png" width="640" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;div>While it’s clear that there are differences between the disassembly, it’s often much easier to understand the differences by reconstructing the control flow graph to get a per-basic-block view of differences. By clicking on the “View:” drop-down box and selecting the assembly language you see, you can get a CFG view. I find showing absolute values rather than relative values helps to understand performance differences better, so I also chose “Absolute numbers” in the drop down box on the far right:&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-intetvmwToI/V2F-WH08lII/AAAAAAAAFh0/1rNkIiUEtOAtQ1QeWVaSXkXExXjK-8rqACLcB/s1600/profile_view_cfg.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="196" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-intetvmwToI/V2F-WH08lII/AAAAAAAAFh0/1rNkIiUEtOAtQ1QeWVaSXkXExXjK-8rqACLcB/s640/profile_view_cfg.png" width="640" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;">There is obviously a single hot basic block, and there are differences in instructions in the 2 versions. The number in the red side-bar shows that the number of cycles spent in this basic block has increased from 431M to 716M. In just a few clicks, I managed to drill down to the key codegen change that caused the performance difference!&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;">We combine the above workflow with the llvmbisect tool available at &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project/zorg/trunk/llvmbisect/">http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project/zorg/trunk/llvmbisect/&lt;/a> to also quickly find the commit introducing the performance difference. We find that using both the above LNT workflow and the llvmbisect tool are vital to be able to act quickly on performance deltas.&lt;/div>&lt;h2>Pointers on setting up your own LNT server for tracking performance&lt;/h2>&lt;div>&lt;div>Setting up an LNT server is as simple as running the half a dozen commands documented at &lt;a href="http://lnt.llvm.org/quickstart.html">http://lnt.llvm.org/quickstart.html&lt;/a> under "Installation" and "Viewing Results". The "Running tests" section is specific to LLVM tests, the rest is generic to performance tracking of general software.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>The documentation for the json file format to submit results to the LNT server is here: &lt;a href="http://lnt.llvm.org/importing_data.html">http://lnt.llvm.org/importing_data.html&lt;/a>.&lt;/div>&lt;div>The documentation for how to also add profile information, is at &lt;a href="http://lnt.llvm.org/profiles.html">http://lnt.llvm.org/profiles.html&lt;/a>.&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #128, June 13th 2016</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/06/llvm-weekly-128-june-13th-2016.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2016 05:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/06/llvm-weekly-128-june-13th-2016.html</guid><description>

The main changes are a switch to reference counting and NumPy compatibility.&lt;/p>&lt;p>I don't want to become "C++ weekly", but I think this audience appreciates a fun use of C++ features. &lt;a href="https://woboq.com/blog/verdigris-qt-without-moc.html">Verdigris&lt;/a> is a header-only library that allows you to use Qt5 without the moc preprocessor.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The call for papers for the &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/100107.html">3rd workshop on the LLVM compiler infrastructure in HPC&lt;/a> has been published.

Some questions were raised about how useful the proposed extensions will be. Sergey Yakoushkin provided more background on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/100162.html">how these features are used&lt;/a> in a commercial codebase. As Elena notes, these features don't need to all be upstreamed at once (or at all), and are mostly independent.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Lang Hames has posted a heads-up about &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/100061.html">upcoming breaking API changes for ORC and MCJIT&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Sean Silva has kicked off a discussion on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/100021.html">the state of IRPGO&lt;/a>. You might ask what is IRPGO? This is profile-guided optimisation performed through instrumentation at the LLVM IR level, as opposed to FEPGO where instrumentation is added by the frontend (e.g. Clang), prior to lowering to IR. Sean would like to make IRPGO the default on all platforms other than Apple at the moment (who may require a longer deprecation period). A number of followup comments discuss possibilities for ensuring all platforms can move forward together, and ensuring a sensible flag exists to choose between frontend or middle-end PGO.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>What exactly is a register pressure set? Both &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/100004.html">Quentin Colombet&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/100019.html">Andrew Trick&lt;/a> have answers for us.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>New optimisations covering checked arithmetic were added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL271152">r271152&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL271153">r271153&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Advanced unrolling analysis is now enabled by default. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL270478">r270478&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The initial version of a new chapter to the 'Kaleidoscope' tutorial has been committed.

This kicked off a pretty interesting discussion. Sanjoy Das highlighted what he sees as the &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099743.html">most important issues to discuss&lt;/a>. A number of follow-ups discussed whether enough code uses floating point values as an induction variable to be worth optimising. There was also the question of &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099819.html">should vectorisation be pursued at any cost?&lt;/a>. Even if a loop can be made vectorisable through loop-versioning with run-time checks, is it worth the code size? Is the &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099814.html">cost of maintaining the compiler code&lt;/a> worthwhile?

Everyone who has responsed so far is in favour.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Jia Chen, GSoC student with LLVM, has noted the CFL-AA pass seems to be mostly working now and would &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099742.html">appreciate reports from people trying it out on their codebases&lt;/a>.So far, Geoff Berry &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099900.html">reports&lt;/a> no correctness issues but seemingly very limited changes in the generated code for SPEC and the LLVM test-suite.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Adam Nemet is seeking feedback on the idea of &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099873.html">adding optimisation remarks to indicate where non-temporal stores may be profitable&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Quentin Colombet has &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099752.html">summarised recent discussion on policies to help release management&lt;/a> and detailed the automatic hooks he hopes to explore next for updating bugs when referenced in a commit message. The following discussion looked at how these hooks may be implemented and what level of rigidity would be most beneficial to the community.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Dean Michael Berris is looking for a way of &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099759.html">defining a default implementation for a pseudo-instruction&lt;/a>.

Jos Dirkens has written a &lt;a href="http://www.smartjava.org/content/getting-started-scala-native">getting started guide&lt;/a> if you want to compile it and try it out. There's also more information in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/densh/talks/blob/master/2016-05-11-scala-goes-native.pdf">slides from the announcement talk&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>More of the students taking part in Google Summer of Code with LLVM-related projects have introduced themselves and their plans. Vivek Pandya will be working on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099492.html">interprocedural register allocation&lt;/a>. Scott Egerton will be working on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099704.html">capture tracking improvements&lt;/a>. Jie Chen will be working on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099573.html">better alias analysis, specifically improving cfl-aa&lt;/a>. Matthias Reisinger will be working on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099471.html">enabling polyhedral optimisations in Julia&lt;/a>, and Zhengyan Liu has plans for &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099600.html">SAFECode memory hardening&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Renato Golin kicked off a discussion about &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099541.html">whether LLVM's release process could be better aligned with downstream users&lt;/a>. This thread covered a broad range of topics and triggered a lot of discussion, but luckily there's no need to summarise it as Renato has &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099706.html">done the job for us&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Nicolai Hähnle notes that currently libLLVM.so &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099398.html">contains about 1.7MB in its .data.rel.ro section&lt;/a>, of which about 1.3MB comes from the MCInstrDesc tables created by tablegen representing a massive number of pointers to be relocated. He suggests reducing this by using offsets instead. Reducing the relocations will both reduce binary size and increase the portion of the binary that can be mapped as shared. So far, responses to the thread are supportive of the idea.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>James Knight has written a detailed post on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099490.html">how it's not really possible to write an LL/SC loop guaranteed to make forward progress in LLVM IR right now&lt;/a>. There are restrictions on what you can do between a load-linked and a store-conditional instruction that the code generator may not meet.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A public &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/llvm-foundation">llvm-foundation&lt;/a> mailing list has been &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099574.html">announced&lt;/a>, which to facilitate discussions related to the Foundation.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>As well as the long, technically detailed and precise threads each week it's nice to highlight cases where a simple question has a simple answer. How do you register a pass as being opt-in based on a command-line flag? &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099470.html">Answer&lt;/a>: have it run every time, but return immediately if the desired command line flag isn't present.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Sanjoy Das has shared an RFC on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099693.html">adding a callee-saved register verifier&lt;/a>. As is clarified later in the thread, the intention is to ensure that code not generated by LLVM (e.g. output from another JIT or hand-written assembly) properly adheres to the calling convention and doesn't clobber registers it shouldn't. The proposed pass would simply add code to check that the test values written to the callee-saved registers aren't modified.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>In response to questions about pass ordering, Mehdi Amini has written a helpful description of &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099477.html">what exactly happens when you do opt -mymodulepass0 -myfunctionpass -mymodulepass1&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Konstantin Vladimirov wonders &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099494.html">if there's an option to force the register allocator to use as many architectural registers as possible to reduce dependencies&lt;/a>. The short answer is there isn't currently, but it would be interesting to investigate.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Diana Picus has shared an RFC on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099594.html">modifying llc so it no longer exits after the first error&lt;/a>. Generally people are in favour, and the patch should hopefully land soon (it had to be temporarily backed out after exposing some test cases failures in lldb).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Nico Weber has noted that now with AVX512, &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2016-May/048837.html">Clang's intrinsics headers are huge&lt;/a>. This can cause compile time issues, for instance Nico reports building all of the v8 JS engine is 6% faster after removing the avx512 includes. The thread participants haven't yet decided on the best way forward to fix this, beyond the potential immediate step of adding include guards so AVX512 intrinsic headers aren't included when not compiling for AVX512 platforms.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The outdated guide on cross-compiling LLVM has been brought up to date. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL269054">r269054&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The WebAssembly backend gained preliminary fast instruction selection (fast-isel) support. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL269083">r269083&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL269203">r269203&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL269273">r269273&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Loop unrolling (other than in the case of explicit pragmas) is now disabled at &lt;code>-Os&lt;/code> in LLVM. You may recall last week it was enabled for &lt;code>-Os&lt;/code> in Clang, but with different thresholds. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL269124">r269124&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new cost-tracking system has been implemented for the loop unroller. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL269388">r269388&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM's Sparc backend has seen the addition of more LEON-specific features, e.g. signed and unsigned multiply-accumulate. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL268908">r268908&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>llc's &lt;code>-run-pass&lt;/code> option will now work with any pass known to the pass registry. Previously it would silently do nothing if you specify indirectly added analysis passes or passes not present in the optimisation pipeline. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL269003">r269003&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>WebAssembly register stackification and coloring are now run very late in the optimisation pipeline. The commit message suggests it's useful to think of these passes as domain-specific liveness-based compression rather than a conventional optimisation. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL269012">r269012&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>When declaring global in textual LLVM IR, you must now assign them with e.g. &lt;code>@0 = global i32 42&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL269096">r269096&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The internal assembler is now enabled by default for 32-bit MIPS targets. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL269560">r269560&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang now supports &lt;code>__float128&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL268898">r268898&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang gained a new warning that triggers when casting away calling conventions from a function. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL269116">r269116&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The recently developed include-fixer tools now has documentation. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL269167">r269167&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>compiler-rt's CMake build system can now build builtins without a full toolchain, allowing you to bootstrap a cross-compiler. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL268977">r268977&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLD will now sort relocations to optimise dynamic linker performance. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL269066">r269066&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #123, May 9th 2016</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/05/llvm-weekly-123-may-9th-2016.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 01:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/05/llvm-weekly-123-may-9th-2016.html</guid><description>

The draft text can be found &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/D13741">here&lt;/a>. As well as a number of messages offering a "+1" to the current text, concerns were raised by some about the implications of "violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them", and about how the committee enforcing the CoC will be selected.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Amos Robinson wrote to the mailing list with &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099034.html">an optimisation missed by LLVM's current Global Value Numbering pass&lt;/a>. Rather excitingly, Daniel Berlin &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099035.html">reports&lt;/a> he's working on a &lt;a href="https://github.com/dberlin/llvm-gvn-rewrite/branches">new GVN implementation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Chandler Carruth has written an update on the &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099121.html">state of work to move to the new pass manager&lt;/a>. He notes the major missing piece at the moment is the ability to communicate invalidation information between two parts of the pass manager.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Jonas Hahnfield has shared an RFC on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/098980.html">automatically generating non-temporal loads and stores&lt;/a>. Some respondents are very strongly against this, suggesting it's something better left for the programmer to specify.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Some of the students taking part in Google Summer of Code this year with LLVM-related projects have been introducing themselves on the mailing list. Utpal Bora will be working on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-May/099373.html">implementing Polly as an analysis pass in LLVM&lt;/a>.

There's a lot of support for this direction, with most comments discussing ways of better tagging commit messages (post-commit in phabricator/bugzilla, or through getting committers to write commit messages in a certain format).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM's CppBackend has been removed. As the commit message says, this backend has bit-rotted to the extent that it's not useful for its original purpose and doesn't generate code that compiles. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL268631">r268631&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The AVR backend has seen a large amount of code merged in to LLVM. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL268722">r268722&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The MIPS backend has seen some large changes to how relocations are handled. These are now represented using MipsMCExpr instead of MCSymbolRefExpr. As someone who has done quite a lot of (out-of-tree) LLVM backend work, I've always found it odd how some architectures have globally visible enum members in include/llvm/MC/MCExpr.h. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL268379">r268379&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM builds should hopefully now be deterministic by default, as &lt;code>LLVM_ENABLE_TIMESTAMPS&lt;/code> is now opt-in rather than opt-out.

Perhaps the most apparent user-visible change is that the C++ frontend now defaults to C++14.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The Rust compiler has &lt;a href="http://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/04/19/MIR.html">introduced a new intermediate representation&lt;/a>, MIR, used for optimisations prior to lowering to LLVM IR.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Tanya Lattner has &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2016/04/llvm-foundation-2016-announcements.html">written about the LLVM Foundation's plans for 2016&lt;/a>.

Renato Golin &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-April/098811.html">flagged up some concerns&lt;/a>, with Chandler Carruth &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-April/098814.html">offering a counterpoint&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Discussion has continued on the proposal to introduce a new LLVM sub-project for parallelism runtime and support libraries. This is probably best summarised by reading &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-April/098734.html">Hal Finkel's thoughts on the way forward&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-April/098820.html">C Bergström's concerns&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-April/098822.html">Jason Henline's proposed charter for the subproject&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Peter Collingbourne has shared an &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-April/098832.html">RFC on redesigning the LLD symbol table&lt;/a> in order to improve memory locality.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM now supports indirect call promotion based on value-profile information.

Currently this disables section merging at the cost of a potentially much larger output. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL268056">r268056&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The symbol table in LLD's ELF linker has been redesigned with the intent of improving memory locality.

&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">With 2016 upon us, the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/foundation">LLVM Foundation&lt;/a> would like to announce our plans for the year. If you are not familiar with the LLVM Foundation, we are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that supports the LLVM Project and its community. We are best known for our LLVM Developers’ Meetings, but we are introducing several new programs this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">The LLVM Foundation originally grew out of the need to have a legal entity to plan and support the annual LLVM Developers’ Meeting and LLVM infrastructure. However, as the Foundation was created we saw a need for help in other areas related to the LLVM project, compilers, and tools. The LLVM Foundation has established 3 main programs: Educational Outreach, Grants &amp;amp; Scholarships, and Women in Compilers &amp;amp; Tools.&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">&lt;b>Educational Outreach&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">The LLVM Foundation plans to expand its educational materials and events related to the LLVM Project and compiler technology and tools.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">First, the LLVM Foundation is excited to announce the 2016 Bay Area LLVM Developers’ Meeting will be held November 3-4 in San Jose, CA. This year will be the 10th anniversary of the developer meeting which brings together developers of LLVM, Clang, and related projects. For this year’s meeting, we are increasing our registration cap to 400 in order to allow more community members to attend.&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">We also are investigating how we can support or be involved in other conferences in the field of compilers and tools. This may include things such as LLVM workshops or tutorials by sponsoring presenters, or providing instructional materials. We plan to work with other conference organizers to determine how the LLVM Foundation can be helpful and develop a plan going forward.&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">However, we want to do more for the community and have brainstormed some ideas for the coming year. We plan to create some instructional videos for those just beginning with LLVM. These will be short 5-10 minute videos that introduce developers to the project and get them started. Documentation is always important, but we find that many are turning to videos as a way to learn.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">&lt;b>Grants &amp;amp; Scholarships&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">We are creating a grants and scholarships program to cover student presenter travel expenses to the LLVM Developers’ Meetings. However, we also hope to expand this program to include student presenter travel to other conferences where the student is presenting their LLVM related work. Details on this program will be published once they have been finalized.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">&lt;b>Women in Compilers &amp;amp; Tools&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">Grace Hopper invented the first compiler and yet women are severely underrepresented in the field of compilers and tools. At the 2015 Bay Area LLVM Developers’ Meeting, we held a BoF on this topic and brainstormed ideas about what can be done. One idea was to increase LLVM awareness at technical conferences that have strong female participation. One such conference is the Grace Hopper Conference (GHC). The LLVM Foundation has submitted a proposal to present about LLVM and how to get involved with the LLVM open source community. We hope our submission is accepted, but if not, we are exploring other ways we can increase our visibility at GHC. Many of the other ideas from this BoF are being considered and actionable plans are in progress.&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;">&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">In addition, to these 3 programs, we will continue to support the LLVM Project’s infrastructure. The &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/">llvm.org&lt;/a> server will move to a new machine to increase performance and reliability. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px; min-height: 13px;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div style="-webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 11px;">We hope that you are excited about the work the LLVM Foundation will be doing in 2016.

There's about a month before they start coding. The time between now and then is the 'community bonding period', so please do make them feel welcome.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The preliminary release schedule for LLVM/Clang 3.8.1 has &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-April/098637.html">been published&lt;/a>. This would have a deadline of May 25th for requesting changes to be merged and would see the final release on June 15th.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A series of RFCs have been posted around the idea of &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-April/098355.html">adding an EfficiencySanitizer tool&lt;/a>. Like the existing sanitizer tools, this would rely on compiler-based dynamic instrumentation in order to detect problems in user code. The goal is to collect userful information with overhead less than 5x, ideally closer to 3x. Separate threads have been started to discuss an &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-April/098658.html">EfficiencySanitizer cache fragmentation tool&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-April/098491.html">a working set tool&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Sanjoy Patel has proposed &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-April/098642.html">removing the llvm.expect intrinsic&lt;/a>, in favour of using metadata to represent the same information. There isn't currently &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-April/098657.html">full agreement on this&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Richard Trieu is seeking feedback on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2016-April/048508.html">which floating point to boolean conversions should trigger warnings&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>How do you add fixup information to a MachineInstruction? Tim Northover &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-April/098511.html">has the answer&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Elena Lepilkina has shared an &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-April/098372.html">RFC on adding support for custom metrics and test parameterisation to LNT&lt;/a>. The feedback so far seems positive.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Phil Tomson is looking for &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-April/098535.html">advice on instruction scheduling in LLVM&lt;/a>. As he notes in his email, it's part of LLVM that's seen a lot of changes over the past 8 years or so. I'm certainly interested in the answer here.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>An implementation of optimisation bisection support has landed. This helps to track down bugs by allowing optimisations to be selectively disabled at compile-time to identify the one introducing a miscompile. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL267022">r267022&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The AArch64 and ARM thread pointer intrinsics have been merged to make a target-independent &lt;code>llvm.thread.pointer&lt;/code> intrinsic. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL266818">r266818&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The llvm.load.relative intrinsic has been added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL267233">r267233&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>There have been more changes to DebugInfo which will require a bitcode upgrade. A script to perform this upgrade is linked in the commit message. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL267296">r27296&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The ORC JIT API improved its support for RPC, including support for calling functions with return values. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL266581">r266581&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The patchable-function function attribution has been introduced, indicating that the function should be easily patchable at runtime. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL266715">r266715&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The IntrReadArgMem intrinsic property has been split in to IntrReadMem and IntrArgMemOnly. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL267021">r267021&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The MachineCombiner gained the ability to combine AArch64 fmul and fadd in to an fmadd. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL267328">r267328&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Scheduling itineraries were added for Sparc, specifically for the LEON processors. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL267121">r267121&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A prototype of an include fixing tool was created. The indexer remains to be written. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL266870">r266870&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new warning has been added, which will trigger if the compiler tries to make an implicit instantiation of a template but cannot find the template definition. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL266719">r266719&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Initial driver flags for EfficiencySanitizer were added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL267059">r267059&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The initial EfficiencySanitizer base runtime library was added to compiler-rt.

Currently these functions aren't constant-folded as the internal APFloat class doesn't implement them and long double operations aren't portable. Solutions include adding support to APFloat, linking against libMPFR to provide compile-time evaluation, or recognising when the long double format of the host and target are the same, so the host math library can be called. From the responses so far, there seems to be some push-back on adding the libMPFR dependency.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Sanjoy Das has an RFC on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-April/098034.html">adding a patchable-prologue attribute&lt;/a>. This would be used to indicate that the function's prologue is compiled so as to provide support for easy hot-patching.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Ulrich Weigand has shared a patch for &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/lldb-dev/2016-April/010067.html">supporting LLDB on Linux on SystemZ&lt;/a>. The patchset contains many big-endian fixes, and may be of interest to others looking at porting LLDB.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The Swift calling convention as well as support for the 'swifterror' argument has been added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL265433">r265433&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL265480">r265480&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Work on GlobalISel continues with many commits related to the assignment of virtual registers to register banks. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL265445">r265445&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL265440">r265440&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM will no longer perform inter-procedural optimisation over functions that can be "de-refined". &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL265762">r265762&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The substitutions supported by lit are now documented. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL265314">r265314&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Unrolled loops now execute the remainder in an epilogue rather than the prologue.

As described in the accompanying documentation, along with deoptimization operand bundles this allows frontends to express guards or checks on optimistic assumptions made during compilation. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL264976">r264976&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for a number of new Altivec instructions has been added. Amazingly, this includes BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) instructions. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL264568">r264568&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The concept of MachineFunctionProperties has been introduced, with the first property being AllVRegsAllocated. This allows passes to declare that they require a particular property, in this case requiring that they be run after regalloc. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL264593">r264593&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>On X86, push will now be used in preference to mov at all optimisation levels (before it was only enabled for &lt;code>-Os&lt;/code>). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL264966">r264966&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM's support library can now compute SHA1 hashes. This is used to implement a 'build-id'. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL265094">r265094&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL265095">r265095&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>When metadata is only referenced in a single function, it will now be emitted just in that function block. The aim of this is to improve the potential of lazy-loading. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL265226">r265226&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The Lanai backend is now supported in the Clang driver. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL264655">r264655&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>libTooling gained a handy formatAndApplyAllReplacements function. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL264745">r264745&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Parts of LLD are starting to use the new Error handling. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL264910">r264910&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL264921">r264921&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL264924">r264924&lt;/a>, and more.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Infrastructure was added to LLD for generating thunks (as required on platforms like MIPS when calling PIC code from non-PIC). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL265059">r265059&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>My Little LLVM: Undefined Behavior is Magic!</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/04/undefined-behavior-is-magic.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/04/undefined-behavior-is-magic.html</guid><description>

This adds support for LLVM 3.8.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Last week, Jia Chen's thread about &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/096851.html">pointer analysis in LLVM&lt;/a> had yet to receive replies. It's now received some extensive discussion. Daniel Berlin argues there is &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/097152.html">lower hanging fruit than improving AA&lt;/a>. It does seem there's &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/097372.html">interest in getting in getting cfl-aa turned on by default&lt;/a>, which will require some careful bug fixing.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The issue of LLD and fatal errors has again surfaced on the mailing list. The more productive line of discussion focused around what should be expected of LLD when given maliciously corrupted inputs. Rui Ueyama is suggesting &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/097445.html">adding a verifier pass&lt;/a> which could be optionally enabled or disabled.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Andrew Kaylor has shared an &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/097617.html">RFC on adding new support to help triage optimisation-related failures&lt;/a>. Optimisation passes are assigned numbers which can be used to help bisect a failure. Michael Gottesman reports &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/097637.html">a similar approach used in Swift&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Samuel F Antao has &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2016-March/048087.html">summarised recent discussion on unified offloading support in Clang&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Duncan P. N.

Krzysztof Parzyszek is kind enough to provide a &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/097489.html">clear and straight-forward answer&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Applications for Google Summer of Code have closed, but the &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/097380.html">list of new project ideas&lt;/a> from Philip Reames is a good starting point for anybody looking for a way to get stuck in to making impactful contributions to LLVM.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new utility, &lt;code>update_test_checks.py&lt;/code> was added to update opt or llc test cases with new FileCheck patterns. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL264357">r264357&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Non-power-of-2 loop unroll count pragmas are now supported. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL264407">r264407&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The NVPTX backend gained a new address space inference pass. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL263916">r263916&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Instances of Error are now convertible to &lt;code>std::error_code&lt;/code>.

More details about Summer of Code are available &lt;a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/">here&lt;/a>. The deadline for applications is this Friday, March 25th at 1900 GMT. I'd also encourage you to look at &lt;a href="http://www.lowrisc.org/docs/gsoc-2016-ideas/">lowRISC's project ideas&lt;/a> if you have an interest in open source hardware.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Stephen Kelly has written about his &lt;a href="https://steveire.wordpress.com/2016/03/19/aaargh-aaa-right-good-and-hygenic/">new Clang-based tool for porting a C++ codebase to use almost-always-auto&lt;/a>. As was pointed out on Twitter, Ryan Stortz from Trail of Bits has a tools that removes auto and does &lt;a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/clang-tidy-audit">roughly the opposite&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Honza Hubička has written up his experiments of &lt;a href="http://hubicka.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/building-libreoffice-with-gcc-6-and-lto.html">building LibreOffice with GCC6 and LTO&lt;/a>. This includes a comparison to a build using LLVM and Clang.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Nick Clifton has shared an update for February and March &lt;a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2016-03/msg00164.html">on the GNU toolchain&lt;/a> that may be of interest.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The developer of the Capstone disassembly framework and the Unicorn multi-architecture simulator is running a funding campaign for the &lt;a href="http://www.keystone-engine.org/">Keystone multi-architecture assembler framework&lt;/a>. Like Capstone, this will build on LLVM but also &lt;a href="http://www.keystone-engine.org/docs/beyond_llvm.html">aims to go beyond it&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Ehsan Amiri has shared an &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/096901.html">RFC on a change in the InstCombine canonical form&lt;/a>. In the ensuing discussion, the question of the current state of the typeless pointer work was raised &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/096928.html">and answered&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Sean Silva has shared some &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/096879.html">recent performance observations about LLD with --build-id&lt;/a>. Adding support for this option has added a measurable slowdown which should be considered when reviewing comparisons with other linkers from before it was added.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>I normally prefer to link to mailing list threads where there has already been some discussion or attempts at answers, but I think this one is worth some more eyeballs. Jia Chen is interested in &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/096851.html">the tradeoffs in LLVM using more sophisticated pointer analyses&lt;/a>. There are no responses at the time of writing, but it seems an interesting question.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Huw Davies has proposed a &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/096762.html">new IR attribute, incoming-stack-align&lt;/a>.

If you have an interest in open source hardware, in my (biased) opinion you should definitely look at &lt;a href="http://www.lowrisc.org/docs/gsoc-2016-ideas/">lowRISC's listed project ideas&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>LLVM and Clang 3.8 'final' &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/096319.html">has been tagged&lt;/a>. A release should be imminent.&lt;/p>&lt;p>There was a big C++ committee meeting last week. You can find summaries &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/48zp05/what_we_added_to_the_c17_working_draft/">here&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://usingstdcpp.org/2016/03/05/trip-report-c-meeting-at-jacksonville/">here&lt;/a>. If you were hoping for modules, concepts, UFCS, ranges, or coroutines in C++17 I'm afraid you're in for disappointment. Many new features will be available in C++ Technical Specifications though.&lt;/p>&lt;p>llvmlite 0.9.0 has been &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/096199.html">released&lt;/a>. llvmlite is a light-weight Python binding for LLVM. If you're wondering how to get started with llvmlite, then check out this recent blog post from Ian Bertolacci on &lt;a href="https://ian-bertolacci.github.io/llvm/llvmlite/python/compilers/programming/2016/03/06/LLVMLite_fibonacci.html">writing fibonacci in LLVM with llvmlite&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Andi McClure has written a really interesting blog post about &lt;a href="http://msm.runhello.com/p/1003">writing software without a compiler&lt;/a>. In this case, generating LLVM IR from LuaJIT.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>John McCall has posted an RFC on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/096250.html">implementing the Swift calling convention in LLVM and Clang&lt;/a>. Feedback is generally positive and there's an interesting discussion on the handling of Swift's errors in the calling convention.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Roel Jordans has &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-March/096205.html">posted some thoughts and questions in preparation for the EuroLLVM birds of a feather sessions on compilers in education&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Peter Collingbourne has shared a new RFC on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/096146.html">adding a new ABI for virtual calls&lt;/a>, termed the 'relative ABI'.

In response to some concerns, Chris Lattner points out that using GitHub in this case &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095942.html">doesn't mean abandoning the current development workflow&lt;/a>, it just means it can be augmented with GitHub-style pull requests for those who prefer it. Chandler &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095943.html">summarised the thread&lt;/a> and provided a list of next steps.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Sanjoy Das &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095833.html">pointed out a potential soundness issue with the &lt;code>available_externally&lt;/code> linkage type&lt;/a>. This triggered a very long discussion. James Knight pointed out the same issue &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095935.html">could happen with normal functions in a shared library&lt;/a>. There was some back and forth between Hal Finkel and Chandler Carruth &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/096025.html">on the best approach to addressing this problem&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Philip Reames asks whether &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095964.html">a PHI depending on another PHI in the same basic block is valid&lt;/a>. It's currently accepted by the verifier but arguably shouldn't be. So far, nobody has argued that it should be valid.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Matthias Braun kicked off a discussion on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095947.html">better defining the semantics of reserved and unallocatable registers&lt;/a>. After more discussion, he followed up with a &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095999.html">revised definition&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>David Li has posted a &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/096077.html">proposal for supporting in-process merging of profile data&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The Sparc backend now contains definitions for all registers and instructions defined in the Sparc v8 manual. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL262133">r262133&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM gained a basic LoopPassManager, though it currently only contains dummy passes. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261831">r261831&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A number of TargetInstrInfo predicates now take a reference to a MachineInstr rather than a pointer. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261605">r261605&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The WebAssembly backend gained redzone support for the userspace stack. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261662">r261662&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Whole-program vtable optimisation is now available in Clang using the &lt;code>-fwhole-program-vtables&lt;/code> flag. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261767">r261767&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang gained &lt;code>__builtin_canonicalize&lt;/code> which returns the platform-specific canonical encoding of a floating point number. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL262122">r262122&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A hasAnyName matcher was added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261574">r261574&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The pointer arithmetic checker has been improved to report fewer false positives. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261632">r261632&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The new ELF linker gained support for identical code folding (ICF). This reduces the size of an LLD binary by 3.6% and of a Clang binary by 2.7%. As described in the commit message, this is not a "safe" version of ICF as implemented in GNU gold, so will cause issues if the input relies on two distinct functions always having distinct addresses. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261912">r261912&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Polly's tree now contains an &lt;code>update_check.py&lt;/code> script that may be useful to other LLVM devs. It updates a FileCheck-based lit test by updating the &lt;code>CHECK:&lt;/code> lines with the actual output of the &lt;code>RUN:&lt;/code> command. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261899">r261899&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLDB gained a new set of plugins to help debug Java programs, specifically Java code JIT-ed by the Android runtime. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL262015">r262015&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The new OpenMP 4.5 affinity API is now supported in LLVM's openmp implementation. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261915">r261915&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The new ELF linker gained support for the &lt;code>-r&lt;/code> command-line option, which produces relocatable output (partial linking). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261838">r261838&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The CMake/lit runner for SPEC in the LLVM test-suite can now run the C CPU2006 floating point benchmarks (but not the Fortran ones). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261816">r261816&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The old ELF linker has been deleted from LLD. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL262158">r262158&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #112, Feb 22nd 2016</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/02/llvm-weekly-112-feb-22nd-2016.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2016 03:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/02/llvm-weekly-112-feb-22nd-2016.html</guid><description>

This intends to replace LLVM as the optimising backend to their fourth-tier JIT. The article describes in detail their reasons for moving away from LLVM (mainly compile-time) and the design trade-offs made, such as in reducing memory allocations and minimising pointer-chasing in the IR. This reminds me of the trade-offs Mike Pall made in the &lt;a href="http://wiki.luajit.org/SSA-IR-2.0">LuaJIT 2.0 IR&lt;/a>. Philip Reames also shared &lt;a href="http://www.philipreames.com/Blog/2016/02/15/quick-thoughts-on-webkits-b3/">some initial thoughts on B3&lt;/a>. I know some people have expressed disappointment about WebKit moving away from LLVM, but if you'll allow me to insert just a little bit of editorial I'd argue B3 is a very positive development for LLVM and the wider compiler community. B3 explores a different set of design trade-offs to those chosen for LLVM, and these sort of changes are probably easiest to explore in a fresh codebase.Thanks to this write-up (and hopefully future B3/AIR documentation), we can learn from the B3 developers' experiences and consider if some of their choices will make sense for LLVM. It's also good to remember that LLVM isn't the only feasible route for code generation and optimisation, and we shouldn't treat LLVM's design choices as the one-true way to do things. Impressively, B3 was developed to its current state in only &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11104604">6 months of developer-time&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Version 0.17.0 of LDC, the LLVM-based compiler for the D programming language has &lt;a href="http://forum.dlang.org/thread/cqgwucbznngoiesvbmlk@forum.dlang.org">been released&lt;/a>. You can view a &lt;a href="https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/releases/tag/v0.17.0">detailed changelog here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>GCC6 will feature a whole bunch of new warnings, and &lt;a href="https://gnu.wildebeest.org/blog/mjw/2016/02/15/looking-forward-to-gcc6-many-new-warnings/">this blog post&lt;/a> details many of them.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The schedule for &lt;a href="http://www.llvm.org/devmtg/2016-03/">EuroLLVM 2016&lt;/a> has now been posted. This will be held March 17th-18th in Barcelona.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Bob Wilson proposes that format-security warnings in Clang &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2016-February/047367.html">default to error&lt;/a>. Nico Weber posted a handy &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2016-February/047438.html">summary of the thread&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Sanjoy Das has posted an &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095523.html">RFC on adding guard intrinsics to LLVM&lt;/a>. These would be used in a similar way to the Check opcode in WebKit's new B3 compiler.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Alina Sbirlea proposes adding &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095557.html">bitcode tests to the LLVM test-suite&lt;/a>. Hal Finkel suggests going further and just &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095562.html">pulling Halide in to the LLVM test-suite&lt;/a> as a front-end example that should provide greater test coverage.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Andrew Trick shared some &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095463.html">thoughts on LLVM in light of the WebKit B3 announcement&lt;/a>. "Even when LLVM's compile time problems are largely solved, and I believe they can be, there will always be systemic compile time and memory overhead from design decisions that achieve generality, flexibility, and layering. These are software engineering tradeoffs."&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The PPCLoopDataPrefetch pass has been moved to Transforms/Scalar/LoopDataPrefetch in preparation for it becoming a target-agnostic pass. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261265">r261265&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The cmpxchg LLVM instruction now allows pointer type operands. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261281">r261281&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The X86 backend gained support for a new stack symbol ordering optimisation. This is primarily intended to reduce code size, and produces small but measurable improvements across some SPEC CPU 2000 benchmarks. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260917">r260917&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LLVM C API has been extended to allow it to be used to manipulate the datalayout. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260936">r260936&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Some major work on the LazyCallGraph has been checked in. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261040">r261040&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The AMDGPU backend gained a basic disassembler. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261185">r261185&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The PostOrderFuctionAttrs pass has been ported to the new pass manager. As described in the commit message, this actually represents a major milestone. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261203">r261203&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The Hexagon backend gained support for thread-local storage. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261218">r261218&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A nullPointerConstant AST matcher was added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261008">r261008&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang gained a &lt;code>-Wcomma&lt;/code> warning, which will warn for most uses of the builtin comma operator. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261278">r261278&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLD has sprouted a release notes document. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260960">r260960&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LLVM test-suite's CMake build system saw a number of fixes for SPEC. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL261470">r261470&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #111, Feb 15th 2016</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/02/llvm-weekly-111-feb-15th-2016.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2016 03:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/02/llvm-weekly-111-feb-15th-2016.html</guid><description>

This includes an update to the latest LLVM and Clang trunk. CilkPlus implements the Cilk Plus language extensions for data and task parallelism in Clang.&lt;/p>&lt;p>There's been some more papers appearing from the C++ standards committee. P0225R0, or as you may prefer to call it "&lt;a href="https://isocpp.org/files/papers/p0225r0.html">Why I want Concepts, and why I want them sooner rather than later&lt;/a>" is worth a read. There's also been a few &lt;a href="https://isocpp.org/blog/2016/02/new-papers">other recently published papers&lt;/a> on iterator facades, the filesystem technical specification, and unified function call syntax.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Jacques Pienaar has proposed &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095118.html">upstreaming the 'Lanai' backend&lt;/a>. This is for a CPU design used internally at Google, and the posting of these patches did attract some &lt;a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/02/09/google_processor/">attention in the press&lt;/a>. A good chunk of the ensuing discussion focused on what the bar should be for accepting a new backend upstream. There seem to ultimately be far more people for the upstreaming than against it, but some concern was raised about the ability for others to test the generated code without access to hardware or even simulators.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Natanael Ramos recently worked with LLVM for his bachelor thesis, and as a result &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095083.html">wrote and submitted a tutorial for writing a new LLVM register allocator&lt;/a>. This can also be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/nael8r/How-To-Write-An-LLVM-Register-Allocator/blob/master/HowToWriteAnLLVMRegisterAllocator.rst">on github&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Nolan has been working on an &lt;a href="https://github.com/beholdnec/llvm-m6502">experimental 6502 backend&lt;/a>, and sought some help with a &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095379.html">memory operand folding problem&lt;/a>. He later followed up to the list &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095436.html">with his solution&lt;/a>, and David Chisnall added some &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095439.html">extra thoughts on potential approaches to targeting 6502 or similar architectures&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Hans Wennborg is &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095376.html">looking for help in expanding the release notes for the 3.8 release&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Vaivaswatha Nagaraj has been working on a &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095115.html">control structure analysis&lt;/a> capable of detecting control structures in the CFG and is seeking feedback on his code.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Lang Hames has followed up to his RFC on error handling in LLVM libraries with a detailed post &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095324.html">summarising his thoughts and responding some some feedback&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Sadly, CMake's current Ninja generator &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095266.html">is non-deterministic&lt;/a>. The good news is there is &lt;a href="https://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=15968">already a fix in upstream CMake&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Peter Collingbourne prototyped &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095306.html">a change to reduce DWARF emitter memory consumption&lt;/a>. Early results are very positive.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Philip Reames proposes &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095290.html">removing the inaccessiblememonly attribute from the 3.8 branch&lt;/a>, on the grounds that the major motivating patch was reverted, there has been no further development, and including it in a release may pose a backwards-compatibility concern. There appears to be agreement so far in the responses.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM will be applying for inclusion in the Google Summer of Code this year. If you have a project listed on the 'open projects' page, &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/095087.html">please review and update it if necessary&lt;/a>, or suggest new projects.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The WholeProgramDevirt pass has been added. This implements whole program optimization of virtual calls where the list of callees is known to be fixed. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260312">r260312&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The AVR backend upstreaming continues with the addition of the AVR tablegen instruction definitions. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL60363">r260363&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>There's been a bunch of other work on the new global instruction selection mechanism this week, but the commits I'd pick out are the addition of support for translating Add instructions and for lowering returns. It is currently being tests with the AArch64 backend. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260549">r260549&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260562">r260562&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260600">r260600&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The AArch64 backend gained support (including a scheduling model) for the Qualcomm Kryo CPU. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260686">r260686&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LoopUnrollAnalyzer has been abstracted out from LoopUnrollPass, and gained unit tests for its functionality. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260169">r260169&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>llvm-config gained preliminary Windows support. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260263">r260263&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The details of the convergent attribute have been clarified in the language reference. The convergent attribute will now be removed on functions which provably don't converge or invoke any convergent functions. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260318">r260316&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260319">r260319&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>It is now possible to perform a 3-stage Clang build using CMake. It is suggested in the commit message this may be useful for detecting non-determinism in the compiler by verifying stage2 and stage3 are identical. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260261">r260261&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>ARMv8.2-A can be targeted using appropriate Clang options. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260533">r260533&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang's CMake build system learned the &lt;code>CLANG_DEFAULT_CXX_STDLIB&lt;/code> to set the default C++ standard library. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260662">r260662&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The new LLD ELF linker gained initial link-time optimisation support. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260726">r260726&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLDB has seen some more updates for Python 3 support, though not yet enough for a clean testsuite run. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL260721">r260721&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #110, Feb 8th 2016</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/02/llvm-weekly-110-feb-8th-2016.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2016 08:44:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/02/llvm-weekly-110-feb-8th-2016.html</guid><description>

Unfortunately there was an issue with the recording of the talks so videos will not be available.&lt;/p>&lt;p>JavaScriptCore's &lt;a href="https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/FTLJIT">FTL JIT&lt;/a> is moving away from using LLVM as its backend, towards &lt;a href="https://webkit.org/docs/b3/">B3 (Bare Bones Backend)&lt;/a>. This includes its own &lt;a href="https://webkit.org/docs/b3/intermediate-representation.html">SSA IR&lt;/a>, optimisations, and instruction selection backend.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Source tarballs and binaries are &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/094987.html">now available&lt;/a> for LLVM and Clang 3.8-RC2.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The Zurich LLVM Social &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/094759.html">is coming up this Thursday&lt;/a>, February 11th at 7pm.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Jeremy Bennett has written up a &lt;a href="http://www.embecosm.com/2016/02/05/how-similar-are-gcc-and-llvm-the-user-perspective/">comparison of the Clang and GCC command-line flags&lt;/a>. The headline summary is that 397 work in both GCC and LLVM, 433 are LLVM-only and 598 are GCC-only.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/alepez/vim-llvmcov">vim-llvmcov&lt;/a> has been released. It is a vim plugin to show code coverage using the llvm-cov tool.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Mehdi Amini has posted an &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/094869.html">RFC on floating point environment and rounding mode handling in LLVM&lt;/a>. The work started all the way back in 2014 and has a whole bunch of patches up for review. Chandler Carruth has responded with a &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/094916.html">detail description of his concerns about the current design&lt;/a>, and his proposed alternative seems to be getting a lot of positive feedback.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Morten Brodersen has recently upgraded a number of applications from the old JIT to the new MCJIT under LLVM 3.7.1 but has &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/094908.html">found significant performance regressions&lt;/a>. Some other respondents have seen similar issues, either in compilation time or in reduced code quality in the generated code. Some of the thread participants will be providing specific examples so they can be investigated. It's possible the issue is something as simple as a different default somewhere. Benoit Belley noted &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/094946.html">they saw regressions due to their frontend's use of allocas in 3.7&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Lang Hames kicked off a long discussion about &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/094804.html">error handling in LLVM libraries&lt;/a>. Lang has implemented a new scheme and is seeking feedback on it. There's a lot of discussion that unfortunately I haven't had time to summarise properly. If error handling design interests you, do get stuck in.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Adrian McCarthy has written up details on the &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/lldb-dev/2016-February/009533.html">recent addition of minidump support to LLDB&lt;/a>. Minidumps are the Windows equivalent of a core file.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Juan Wajnerman is looking at adding support for multithreading to the Crystal language, and has a &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/094736.html">question about thread local variables&lt;/a>. LLVM won't re-load the thread local address, which causes issues when a thread local variable is read in a coroutine running on one thread which is then suspended and continued on a different thread. This is apparently a known issue, covered by &lt;a href="https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19177">PR19177&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Steven Wu has posted an &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-February/094851.html">RFC on embedding bitcode in object files&lt;/a>. The intent is to upstream support that already exists in Apple's fork. Understandably some of the respondents asked how this relates to the .llvmbc section that the Thin-LTO work is introducing. Steven indicates it's pretty much the same, but for Mach-O rather than ELF and that he hopes to unify them during the upstreaming.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM now has a memory SSA form. This isn't yet used by anything in-tree, but should form a very useful basis for a variety of analyses and transformations. This patch has been baking for a long time, first being submitted for initial feedback in April last year. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL259595">r259595&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new loop versioning loop-invariant code motion (LICM) pass was introduced. This enables more opportunities for LICM by creating a new version of the loop guarded by runtime checks to test for potential aliases that can't be determined not to exist at compile-time. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL259986">r259986&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LazyValueInfo gained an intersect operation on lattice values, which can be used to exploit multiple sources of facts at once. The intent is to make greater use of it, but already it is able to remove a half range-check when performing jump-threading. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL259461">r259461&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The SmallSet and SmallPtrSet templates will now error out if created with a size greater than 32. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL259419">r259419&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The ability to emit errors from the backend for unsupported features has been refactored, so BPF, WebAssembly, and AMDGPU backends can all share the same implementation. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL259498">r259498&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A simple pass using LoopVersioning has been added, primarily for testing. The new pass will fully disambiguate all may-aliasing memory accesses no matter how many runtime checks are required. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL259610">r259610&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The way bitsets are used to encode type information has now been documented. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL259619">r259619&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>You can now use the flag &lt;code>-DLLVM_ENABLE_LTO&lt;/code> with CMake to build LLVM with link-time optimisation. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL259766">r259766&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>TableGen's AsmOperandClass gained the &lt;code>IsOptional&lt;/code> field. Setting this to 1 means the operand is optional and the AsmParser will not emit an error if the operand isn't present. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL259913">r259913&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>There is now a scheduling model for the Exynos-M1. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL259958">r259958&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang now has builtins for the bitreverse intrinsic. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL259671">r259671&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The option names for profile-guided optimisations with the cc1 driver have been modified. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL259811">r259811&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>AddressSanitizer now supports iOS. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL259451">r259451&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The current policy for using the new ELF LLD as a library has been documented. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL259606">r259606&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Polly's new Sphinx documentation gained a guide on using Polly with Clang. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL259767">r259767&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #109, Feb 1st 2016</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/02/llvm-weekly-109-feb-1st-2016.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2016 06:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2016/02/llvm-weekly-109-feb-1st-2016.html</guid><description>

It is an LLVM IR interpreter using the Truffle framework and Graal on the JVM to support JIT compilation.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Ehsan Akhgari has posted an &lt;a href="https://ehsanakhgari.org/blog/2016-01-29/building-firefox-with-clang-cl-a-status-update">updated on building Firefox with clang-cl&lt;/a>. It is now possible to build a complete Firefox with Clang without using the MSVC fallback once.&lt;/p>&lt;p>I've mentioned it down below in the list of notable commits, but it's worth calling out here too: the old autoconf build-system has now been &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL258861">removed&lt;/a> from LLVM. 3.8 will be the last release to include it. Time to switch to CMake if you haven't already.&lt;/p>&lt;p>John Regehr gave a talk about undefined behaviour in LLVM at the Paris LLVM meetup, and you can find the slides &lt;a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/llvm-ub.pdf">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>James Knight has written to the list to get feedback on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/094576.html">approaches to cleaning up Clang's handling of atomics&lt;/a>. There seems to be widespread support for the cleanup.

Questions include who would be interested and why. John Criswell's &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/094444.html">response&lt;/a> includes some interesting use-cases.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Eduard-Mihai Burtescu has posted an RFC on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/094204.html">making byval argument passing work with opaque pointers&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Quentin Colombet has posted an RFC seeking opinions on the &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/094411.html">contract between LLVM IR and the backends for instruction selection&lt;/a>. In particular, should backends be able to perform instruction selection on any valid LLVM IR. Several people have fed back that in practical terms, a backend doesn't need to be able to select any instruction as long as it provides IR to IR transformations that can perform necessary modifications prior to instruction selection.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Jonas Wagner is looking for feedback on how to support &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/094192.html">self-modifying branches in LLVM&lt;/a>. The thread contained some interesting discussion about the &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/094340.html">cost of well-predicted branches&lt;/a>. It would certainly seem worthwhile to delve deeper to see how much of the overhead is due to limitations in LLVM's basic block at-a-time instruction scheduler.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Philip Reames has written to the list to warn users of the RewriteStatePointsForGC &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/094411.html">that there are currently issues expressing arbitrary exceptional control flow&lt;/a>. The thread discusses some potential solutions to the current issues.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Ed Maste has been working to use libunwind in FreeBSD's base system, and &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/094202.html">queries its stack usage&lt;/a>. LLVM's libunwind allows for 120 saved registers on all architectures, while in contrast the GCC unwinder has a target-dependent maximum (it's 18 on x86-64).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;code>llvm::SplitModule&lt;/code> gained a new flag which can be used to cause it to attempt to split the module without globalizing local objects. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL258083">r258083&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The WebAssembly backend will now rematerialize constants with multiple uses rather than holding them live in registers, as there is no code size saving in using registers in for constants in most cases in the WebAssembly encoding. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL258142">r258142&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Some small patches from the global instruction selection effort have started to land, such as the introduction of a generic machine opcode for ADD (&lt;code>G_ADD&lt;/code>) and the all-important CMake support for building it. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL258333">r258333&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL258344">r258344&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;code>getCacheLineSize&lt;/code> was added to TargetTransformInfo.

On Saturday I proposed to my partner Carrie Anne, and I'm delighted to report that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MissPhilbin/status/688452374260744192">she said yes&lt;/a>. You may well question if this piece of personal news has any relevance to you, and in response I'd like to highlight just how important Carrie Anne is to this weekly newsletter. For over two years now, I've given up 2-3+ hours of my time every week without fail on evenings and weekends, time we could really be spending together as a couple. Without Carrie Anne's understanding and support LLVM Weekly couldn't exist. 2016 is going to be a very exciting year.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Registration is &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/094106.html">now open&lt;/a> for EuroLLVM 2016.

You can find slides from the two &lt;a href="http://www.lowrisc.org">lowRISC&lt;/a> talks &lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/asb/lowrisc-plans-for-risc-v-in-2016">here&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://riscv.org/workshop-jan2016/Wed1115%20untether_wsong83.pdf">here&lt;/a>. You may also want to read my &lt;a href="http://www.lowrisc.org/blog/2016/01/third-risc-v-workshop-day-one/">liveblog of the event&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The BSD Now podcast recently &lt;a href="http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/92191/the-bsd-black-box-bsd-now-122/">interviewed Alex Rosenberg&lt;/a> about his work on LLVM/Clang and FreeBSD.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The folks at QuarksLab have shared a &lt;a href="http://blog.quarkslab.com/clang-hardening-cheat-sheet.html">Clang hardening cheat sheet&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>LLDB 3.8 will &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/golang-nuts/pzpNcarQcvo">feature initial Go debugging support&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The next Paris LLVM Social will be held &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/093610.html">on January 27th&lt;/a> and includes a talk from John Regehr.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The next Zurich LLVM Social &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-December/093589.html">will be taking place on January 14th&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>One long discussion on the lists this week was regarding the design of the new LLD ELF and COFF linkers. Rui Ueyama &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/093712.html">notes that they are currently designed as commands instead of libraries&lt;/a>. e.g. exit() on failure is considered appropriate. Chandler Carruth argues strongly that &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/093760.html">supporting a library interface is important for any project under the LLVM umbrella&lt;/a>. There ultimately seems to be agreement that the ability to use the linker as a library is important for some use cases, but also that the person doing the work (Rui) should be able to go about development in the way that makes most sense to him. He intends to focus first on reaching feature parity with the GNU linker, and then look at issues such as the library interface.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>There's been some discussion in the thread on the new global instruction selection implementation about the &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/093739.html">semantics of inttoptr and ptrtoint&lt;/a>. Specifically whether the currently specified semantics are appropriate for architectures where converting between integers and pointers is not a no-op. It looks like &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/093802.html">Philip Reames, David Chisnall, and others&lt;/a> should share an RFC on this issue in the following weeks.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Matthew Arsenault asks about &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/093662.html">TargetTransformInfo getOperationCost&lt;/a>. Hal Finkel &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/093670.html">points out&lt;/a> the problems Matt is seeing are likely down to there being two cost models. One used for vectorization, and one used for inlining and unrolling.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>James Byerly has an &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/093692.html">interesting question about constraint solving and unspillable register classes&lt;/a>. He is targetting a custom, seemingly micro-coded architecture and hasn't received any responses so far.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Steve King has shared some thoughts on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/093626.html">adding ISD::OPAQUE to complement ISD::BITCAST&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>What is the current status of LLDB on Windows? Zachary Turner has &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/lldb-dev/2016-January/009248.html">written a summary&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Both &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/093706.html">Xilinx&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2016-January/093684.html">Microsoft Research Cambridge&lt;/a> are advertising intern positions on LLVM-related projects.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM gained the &lt;code>-print-funcs&lt;/code> option which can be used to filter IR printing to only certain functions. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL256952">r256952&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LLVM ADT library gained a new sum type abstraction for pointer-like types and an abstraction for embedding an integer within a pointer-like type. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL257282">r257282&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL257284">r257284&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM now recognises the Samsung Exynos M1 core. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL256828">r256828&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>InstCombine learned to expose more constants when comparing getelementptrs (GEPs) by detecting when both GEPs could be expressed as GEPs with the same base pointer. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL257064">r257064&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>SelectionDAGBuilder will set NoUnsignedWrap for an inbounds getelementptr and for load/store offsets. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL256890">r256890&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>AArch64 MachineCombine will now allow fadd and fmul instructions to be reassociated. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL257024">r257024&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Macro emission in DWARFv4 is now supported. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL257060">r257060&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>llvm-symbolizer gained the &lt;code>-print-source-context-lines&lt;/code> option to print source code around the line. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL257326">r257326&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang's CMake build system can now perform a multi-stage bootstrap build with profile-guided optimisation. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL256873">r256873&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang's command line frontend learned to handle a whole bunch of &lt;code>-fno-builtin-*&lt;/code> arguments. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL256937">r256937&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The new ELF LLD linker will now be used for th AMDGPU target. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL257175">r257175&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The performance of string table construction in the LLD ELF linker has been improved.

For targets such as WebAssembly and NVPTX, it of course doesn't make sense to have a fixed size register file. A number of people raised concerns that using virtual registers after register allocation seems like a hack that could result in difficult corner cases, or suggested that supporting infinite (or at least growable) physical register sets might be an interesting alternative. Matthias Braun gave a really good &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-December/093215.html">summary of the issues&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Discussion has continued on adding an HasInaccessibleState attribute. Vaivaswatha Nagaraj summarised the &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-December/093108.html">key points of the discussion so far&lt;/a> while Joseph Tremoulet &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-December/093139.html">shared some thoughts based on his experience on the Microsoft Phoenix compiler&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Alexander Riccio is interested in feedback on his &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2015-December/046384.html">proposal to integrate more static analysis tests&lt;/a>. He's looking to import code published by NIST.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Philip Reames has posted an RFC on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-December/093237.html">extending atomic loads and stores to floating point and vector types&lt;/a>. Feedback appears to be positive.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Hans Wennborg has proposed a &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-December/093273.html">schedule for the 3.8 release&lt;/a>.

Rather than being a simple code dump, development will now occur out in the open with &lt;a href="https://swift.org/contributing/">external contributions encouraged&lt;/a>. If you haven't already, now might be a good time to watch Joseph Groff and Chris Lattner's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ntj8ab-5cvE">talk on the Swift Intermediate Language&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Rui Ueyama &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2015/11/new-elf-linker-from-llvm-project.html">wrote about the new LLD ELF linker&lt;/a> on the official LLVM blog.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The Visual C++ team have released &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2015/12/04/introducing-clang-with-microsoft-codegen-in-vs-2015-update-1.aspx">Clang with Microsoft CodeGen&lt;/a>.

The Clang changes include the addition of an 'API notes' feature which has seen some interest from other developers.

We have been working hard for a few months now to rewrite the ELF support in lld, the LLVM linker. We are happy to announce that it has reached a significant milestone: it is now able to bootstrap LLVM, Clang, and itself and pass all tests on x86-64 Linux and FreeBSD with the speed expected of an LLVM project.&lt;br />&lt;br />ELF is the standard file format for executables on Unix-like systems, such as Linux and BSDs. GNU ld and GNU gold are commonly used linkers for such systems today. In many use cases, the linker is a black box for which only speed matters. Depending on program size, linking a program takes from tens of milliseconds to more than a minute. We designed the new linker so that it runs as fast as possible. Although no serious benchmarking or optimization has been conducted yet, it is consistently observed that the new lld links the LLVM/Clang/lld executables in about half the time of GNU gold. Generated executables are roughly the same size. lld is not at feature parity with gold yet, so it is too early to make a conclusion, but we are working hard to maintain or improve lld’s speed while adding more features.&lt;br />&lt;br />lld is command-line compatible with GNU ld so that it can be used as a drop-in replacement. This does not necessarily mean that we are implementing all the features of the GNU linkers in the same way as they did. Some features are no longer relevant for modern Unix-like systems and can be removed. Some other features can be implemented in more efficient ways than those in the traditional linkers. Writing a new linker from scratch is a rare occasion. We take advantage of this opportunity to simplify the linker while keeping compatibility with the existing linkers for normal use.&lt;br />&lt;br />The new ELF linker is a relatively small program which currently consists of about 7000 lines of C++ code. It is based on the same design as the PE/COFF (Windows) support in lld, so the design document for the PE/COFF support is directly applicable to the ELF support.&lt;br />&lt;br />The older ELF support still exists in lld repository in parallel with the new one. Please be careful to not confuse the two. They are separated at the top directory and do not share code. You can run the new linker with ld.lld command or by passing -fuse-ld=lld to Clang when linking.&lt;br />&lt;br />We are still working on implementing remaining functionality such as improved linker script support or improved support for architectures beyond x86_64. If you are interested in the new linker, &lt;a href="http://lld.llvm.org/getting_started.html">try it out for yourself&lt;/a>.</description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #100, Nov 30th 2015</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/11/llvm-weekly-100-nov-30th-2015.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov 2015 04:41:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/11/llvm-weekly-100-nov-30th-2015.html</guid><description>

I'll admit that nobody has actually written in to beg that LLVM Weekly share travel tips, but I will say that Vienna is a beautiful city that's provided lots to do over the past few days. If you're visiting, I can strongly recommend &lt;a href="http://www.salmbraeu.com/home/">Salm Bräu&lt;/a> for good beer and food.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/98">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>All of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_R5A0lGi1AA4Lv2bBFSwhgDaHvvpVU21">LLVM Dev Meeting Videos&lt;/a> are now up, and will stay up. This includes &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ntj8ab-5cvE">Chris Lattner and Joseph Groff's talk on Swift's IR&lt;/a>. You can also find most of the slides &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2015-10/slides/">here&lt;/a>. The folks at Quarkslab have also &lt;a href="http://blog.quarkslab.com/llvm_dev_meeting.html">posted a trip report&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The big news this week is that code derived from NVIDIA's PGI Fortran compiler &lt;a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/nnsa-national-labs-team-nvidia-develop-open-source-fortran-compiler-technology">is to be open-sourced and a production-grade Fortran front-end to LLVM produced&lt;/a>. This project is a collaboration between the US NNSA (National Nuclear Security Administration), NVIDIA, and the Lawrence Livermore, Sandia, and Los Alamos national laboratories. Hal Finkel has &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-November/092404.html">shared a little more on the LLVM mailing list&lt;/a>. With a source code release not due for about another year, where does this leave the existing &lt;a href="https://github.com/llvm-flang/flang">Flang&lt;/a> efforts? The hope is that &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-November/092422.html">parts of Flang will be merged with the PGI release&lt;/a>. Douglas Miles from the PGI team has also &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-November/092438.html">shared a mini-FAQ&lt;/a>.

See also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHfb8z-iSYk">Jingyue's talk&lt;/a> from the recent LLVM Dev Meeting. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252660">r252660&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A simple MachineInstruction SSA pass for PowerPC has been added. The implementation is short and straight-forward, so worth a read if you want to do some MI-level peephole optimisations for your target. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252651">r252651&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Basic support for AArch64's address tagging has been added. In AArch64, the top 8 bits of an address can be used to store extra metadata with these bits being masked out before going through address translation. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252573">r252573&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The Hexagon backend now supports assembly parsing. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252443">r252443&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The CMake build system gained a new LLVMExternalProjectUtils module. As an example, this is used with the LLVM test suite which can be set up to be rebuilt whenever the in-tree clang or lld change. This could also be used with compiler-rt or libcxx. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252747">r252747&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>An 'empty token' is now defined (written as &lt;code>token empty&lt;/code>) for when using tokens in LLVM IR. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252811">r252811&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LibFuzzer gained a new experimental search heuristic, drill. As the comment in FuzzerLoop.cpp explains, this will 1) read+shuffle+execute+minimize the corpus, 2) choose a random unit, 3) reset the coverage, 4) start fuzzing as if the chosen unit was the only element of the corpus, 5) reset the coverage again when done, 6) merge the newly created corpus into the original one. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252838">r252838&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A BITREVERSE SelectionDAG node and a set of &lt;code>llvm.bitreverse.*&lt;/code> intrinsics have been introduced. The intention is that backends should no longer have to reimplement similar code to match instruction patterns to their own ISA's bitreverse instruction. See also the patch to the ARM backend that replaces ARMISD::RBIT with ISD::BITREVERSE. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252878">r252878&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL253047">r253047&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for &lt;code>__attribute__(internal_linkage)&lt;/code> was added. This is much like C's static keyword, but applies to C++ class methods. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252648">r252648&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang now supports GCC's &lt;code>__auto_type&lt;/code> extension, with a few minor enhancements. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252690">r252690&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul> &lt;li>&lt;p>libcxx gained initial support for building with mustl libc. Primarily this is a new CMake option, necessary as Musl doesn't provide a macro to indicate its presense. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252457">r252457&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Reduce Your Testcases with Bugpoint and Custom Scripts</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/11/reduce-your-testcases-with-bugpoint-and.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2015 20:18:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/11/reduce-your-testcases-with-bugpoint-and.html</guid><description>
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&lt;div style="text-align: left;">&lt;div style="text-align: left;">LLVM provides many useful command line tools to handle bitcode:&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>opt&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;is the most widely known and is used to run individual passes on an IR module, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>llc&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;invokes the backend to generate an assembly or object file from an IR module. Less known but very powerful is&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>bugpoint&lt;/i>, the automatic test case reduction tool, that should be part of every developer's toolbox.&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: left;">The&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>bugpoint&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;tool helps to reduce an input IR file while preserving some interesting behavior, usually a compiler crash or a miscompile. Multiple strategies are involved in the reduction of the test case (shuffling instructions, modifying the control flow, etc.), but because it is oblivious to the LLVM passes and the individual backend specificities, "it may appear to do stupid things or miss obvious simplifications", as stated in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/bugpoint.html#description">official description&lt;/a>. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/Bugpoint.html">documentation&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;gives some insights on the strategies that can be involved by&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>bugpoint&lt;/i>, but the details are&amp;nbsp;beyond the scope of this post.&lt;br />&lt;br />Read on to learn how you can use the power of bugpoint to solve some non-obvious problems.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;">Bugpoint Interface Considered Harmful&lt;/h2>Bugpoint is a powerful tool to reduce your test case, but its interface can lead to frustration (as stated in the documentation: "&lt;i>bugpoint can be a remarkably useful tool, but it sometimes works in non-obvious ways&lt;/i>"). One of the main issue seems to be that&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>bugpoint&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;is ironically too advanced! It operates under three modes and switches automatically among them to solve different kind of problem: crash, miscompilation, or code generation (see&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/Bugpoint.html">the documentation&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;for more information on these modes). However it is not always obvious to know beforehand which mode will be activated and which strategy&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>bugpoint&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;is actually using.&lt;/div>&lt;br />I found that for most of my uses, I don't want the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>advanced&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>bugpoint&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;features that deal with pass ordering for example, and I don't need&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>bugpoint&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;to detect which mode to operate and switch automatically. For most of my usage, the `compile-custom` option is perfectly adequate: similar to&lt;br />`git bisect`, it allows you to provide a script to&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>bugpoint&lt;/i>. This script is a black box for&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>bugpoint&lt;/i>, it needs to accept a single argument (the bitcode file to process) and needs to return 0 if the bitcode does not exhibit the behavior you're interested in, or a non zero value in the other case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>Bugpoint&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;will apply multiple strategies in order to reduce the test case, and will call your custom script after each transformation to validate if the behavior you're looking for is still exhibited. The invocation for&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>bugpoint&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;is the following:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">$ ./bin/bugpoint -compile-custom -compile-command=./check.sh -opt-command=./bin/opt my_test_case.ll&lt;/div>&lt;br />The important part is the two options&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>-compile-custom&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>-compile-command=path_to_script.sh&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;that indicate to&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>bugpoint&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;that it should use your own script to process the file. The other important part is the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>-opt-command&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;option that should point to the correct&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>opt&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;that will be used to reduce the test case. Indeed by default&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>bugpoint&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;will search in the path for&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>opt&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;and may use an old system one that won't be able to process your IR properly, leading to some curious error message:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">*** Debugging code generator crash!&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Checking for crash with only these blocks:&amp;nbsp; diamond .preheader .lr.ph .end: error: Invalid type for value&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">simplifycfg failed!&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>Considering such a script `check.sh`, running it with your original test case this way:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">$ ./check.sh my_test_case.ll &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo "NON-INTERESTING" || echo "INTERESTING"&lt;/div>&lt;br />should display&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: &amp;quot;monaco&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">INTERESTING&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;before you try to use it with bugpoint, or you may very well be surprised. In fact&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>bugpoint&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;considers the script as a compile command. If you start with an&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: &amp;quot;monaco&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">NON-INTERESTING&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;test case and feed it to&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>bugpoint&lt;/i>, it will assume that the code compiles correctly, and will try to assemble it, link it, and execute it to get a reference result. This is where&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>bugpoint&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;behavior can be confusing when it automatically switches mode, leaving the user with a confusing trace. A correct invocation should lead to a trace such as:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">./bin/bugpoint&amp;nbsp; -compile-custom&amp;nbsp; -compile-command=./check.sh&amp;nbsp; -opt-command=./bin/opt slp.ll&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Read input file&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; : 'slp.ll'&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">*** All input ok&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Initializing execution environment: Found command in: ./check.sh&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Running the code generator to test for a crash:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Error running tool:&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">&amp;nbsp; ./check.sh bugpoint-test-program-1aa0e1d.bc&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">*** Debugging code generator crash!&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; min-height: 16px;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Checking to see if we can delete global inits: &amp;lt;crash&amp;gt;&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; min-height: 16px;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">*** Able to remove all global initializers!&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Checking for crash with only these blocks:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; .lr.ph6.preheader .preheader .lr.ph.preheader .lr.ph .backedge&amp;nbsp; ._crit_edge.loopexit... &amp;lt;11 total&amp;gt;: &amp;lt;crash&amp;gt;&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Checking for crash with only these blocks: .preheader .backedge .lr.ph6.preheader:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Checking for crash with only these blocks: .lr.ph ._crit_edge:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">...&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">...&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Checking instruction: &amp;nbsp; store i8 %16, i8* getelementptr inbounds ([32 x i8], [32 x i8]* @cle, i64 0, i64 15), align 1, !tbaa !2&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; min-height: 16px;">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">*** Attempting to perform final cleanups: &amp;lt;crash&amp;gt;&lt;/div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Emitted bitcode to 'bugpoint-reduced-simplified.bc'&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>In practice the ability to write a custom script is very powerful, I will go over a few use cases I recently used&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>bugpoint&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;br />&lt;h2 style="text-align: left;">Search For a String in the Output&lt;/h2>I recently submitted a patch (http://reviews.llvm.org/D14364) for a case where the loop vectorizer didn't kick-in on a quite simple test case. After fixing the underlying issue I needed to submit a test with my patch. The original IR was a few hundred lines. Since I believe it is good practice to reduce test cases as much as possible, bugpoint is often my best friend. In this case the analysis result indicates "Memory dependences are safe with run-time checks" on the output after my patch.&lt;br />&lt;br />Having compiled `opt` with and without my patch and copied each version in `/tmp/` I wrote this shell script:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div style="background-color: black;

I used it in the past to reduce crashes on a specific assertion and avoiding the reduction leading to a different crash, or to reduce for tracking instruction count regressions or any other metric.&lt;br />&lt;h2>Just Use FileCheck&lt;/h2>&lt;div>LLVM comes with a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html">Flexible pattern matching file verifier&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;(FileCheck) that the tests are using intensively. You can annotate your original test case and write a script that reduce it for your patch. Let's take an example from the public LLVM repository with commit&amp;nbsp;r252051&lt;i>&amp;nbsp;"&lt;/i>[SimplifyCFG] Merge conditional stores&lt;i>".&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;The associated test in the validation is test/Transforms/SimplifyCFG/merge-cond-stores.ll ; and it already contains all the check we need, let's try to reduce it. For this purpose you'll need to process one function at a time, or bugpoint may not produce what you expect: because the check will fail for one function, bugpoint can do any transformation to another function and the test would still be considered "interesting". Let's extract the function test_diamond_simple from the original file:&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">$ ./bin/llvm-extract -func=test_diamond_simple test/Transforms/SimplifyCFG/merge-cond-stores.ll -S &amp;gt; /tmp/my_test_case.ll&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Then checkout and compile&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>opt&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;for revision r252050 and r252051, and copy them in /tmp/opt.r252050&amp;nbsp;and /tmp/opt.r252051.

Some cleanup is probably still needed: for instance bugpoint won't convert invoke into calls, &amp;nbsp;remove metadata, tbaa informations, personality function, etc. We also saw before that bugpoint can modify your test in unexpected way, adding&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>undef&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>unreachable&lt;/i>.&amp;nbsp;Also you probably want to rename the variables to end up with a readable test case.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Fortunately, having the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>check.sh&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;script at hand is helpful in this process, since you can just manually modify your test and run continuously the same command:&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;div style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: Monaco; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">$ ./check.sh my_test_case.ll &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo "NON-INTERESTING" || echo "INTERESTING"&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>While the result is &amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="background-color: black; color: whitesmoke; font-family: &amp;quot;monaco&amp;quot;; font-size: 12px;">INTERESTING&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;you know you keep having a valid test and you can continue to proceed with your cleanup.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Keep in mind that bugpoint can do far more, but hopefully this subset will be helpful to the ones that are still struggling with its command line options.&lt;br />&lt;br />Finally, I'm grateful to Manman Ren for her review of this post.&lt;/div>&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #97, Nov 9th 2015</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/11/llvm-weekly-97-nov-9th-2015.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2015 08:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/11/llvm-weekly-97-nov-9th-2015.html</guid><description>

The first set of videos made a brief appearance &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_R5A0lGi1AA4Lv2bBFSwhgDaHvvpVU21">here&lt;/a> but apparently they weren't ready for distribution and have been taken down again.

It now features a baseline JIT in addition to the LLVM JIT.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The LLVM-based ELLCC cross-compilation tool chain has had a &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-November/091899.html">new release, version 0.1.18&lt;/a>. This release has been tested for building the Linux kernel.&lt;/p>&lt;p>There is going to be an LLVM devroom at FOSDEM 2016. Check &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-November/091906.html">here for the call for papers and participation&lt;/a>. The deadline for receiving submissions is December 1st.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>As loyal LLVM Weekly readers will know, for a long time now there's been a movement to replace autoconf in the LLVM build system with CMake. It's now at the point where Chris Bieneman suggests we should consider &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-November/092150.html">deprecating autoconf&lt;/a>. His proposal suggests it is marked deprecated for the 3.8 release and removed after 3.8 branches from the main development tree. This proposal is getting a lot of positive feedback.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>After a discussion about the spotty use of the &lt;code>DEBUG_TYPE&lt;/code> in passes to prefix debug messages, Daniel Berlin makes the suggestion &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-November/091933.html">that a new &lt;code>DEBUG_MSG&lt;/code> macro be introduced&lt;/a> which will always include the &lt;code>DEBUG_TYPE&lt;/code>. Although there are a number of responses indicating how useful they find it when debug messages are prefixed with their source, there doesn't seem to yet be a consensus on whether it's worth replacing all &lt;code>DEBUG(dbgs() &amp;lt;&amp;lt; ..)&lt;/code> with something like this.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>George Burgess is &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2015-November/045935.html">seeking feedback for his proposal on performing nullability analysis in Clang&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Richard Diamond has written a &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-November/091968.html">proposal on introducing an llvm.blackbox intrinsic&lt;/a> with the purpose of explicitly preventing certain optimisations. So far, there's some confusion about exactly what this intrinsic would do, and whether there's an alternative way to achieve the same aims.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>James Molloy &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-November/092094.html">proposes adding a new norecurse attribute&lt;/a>. With no major exceptions, this has actually already been committed. See the commit summary below for more information.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>David Blaikie is planning to implement an llvm-dwp tool to support building a DWARF package file out of a number of .dwo split debug files. He is &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-November/092035.html">seeking feedback&lt;/a> on his plan.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Chris Bieneman has been improving support with the CMake build system for bootstrapping a cross-compiler toolchain and has &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-November/091916.html">run in to issues involving compiler-rt and bootstrapping builtins&lt;/a>. There seems to be some support for the third of the proposed options, splitting the builtins and runtime libraries.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new optimisation was added to SimplifyCFG to merge conditional stores. The commit message notes it has little impact on the standard LLVM test suite, but it apparently causes many changes in a third party suite. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252051">r252051&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Implicit conversions between ilist iterators and pointers are now disabled. All in-tree code has been updated to use explicit conversions, but out-of-tree developers may need to either revert this patch for now or update their code. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252380">r252380&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LoopLoadElimination pass was introduced, which can discover store-to-load forwarding opportunities. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL251972">r251972&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252017">r252017&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Work on operand bundles continues with the addition of a &lt;code>data_operand&lt;/code> abstraction. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252077">r252077&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM gained portable helper macros for packed struct definitions. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252099">r252099&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>DebugInfo has been modified so that a reference to a subprogram is stored in function-level metadata rather than subprograms containing a metadata reference to the function they describe. A script to update out-of-tree textual IR is &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/D14265">attached here&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252219">r252219&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252268">r252268&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;code>norecurse&lt;/code> attribute has been introduced.

These add additional information to a module file that can be queried when it's read, allowing tools built on Clang to stash their own data in module files. See &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2015-October/045740.html">the original mailing list RFC&lt;/a> for more details. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL251955">r251955&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang now supports the &lt;code>__make_integer_seq&lt;/code> template. &lt;code>__make_integer_seq&amp;lt;std::integer_sequence, int, 90000&amp;gt;&lt;/code> takes 0.25 seconds while &lt;code>std::make_integer_sequence&amp;lt;int, 90000&amp;gt;&lt;/code> takes so long the patch author didn't wait for it to finish. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252036">r252036&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The newly-introduced VforkChecker will look for unsafe code in a vforked process. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252285">r252285&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLDB gained an initial Go expression parser. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL251820">r251820&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>compiler-rt now supports 32-bit mingw-w64. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL251928">r251928&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Some initial documentation has been written on &lt;a href="http://lldb.llvm.org/adding-language-support.html">adding programming language support to LLDB&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL251831">r251831&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLDB should now be able to directly launch processors on the iOS simulator. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL252112">r252112&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #95, Oct 26th 2015</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/10/llvm-weekly-95-oct-26th-2015.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2015 08:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/10/llvm-weekly-95-oct-26th-2015.html</guid><description>

Lavavej) has &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/3q4agc/c17_progress_update_oct_2015/">provided a useful summary&lt;/a>. Herb Sutter has also &lt;a href="http://herbsutter.com/2015/10/25/2568/">posted a trip report&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The HHVM team have posted an &lt;a href="http://hhvm.com/blog/10205/llvm-code-generation-in-hhvm">update on the status of LLVM code generation in HHVM&lt;/a>. They managed to get LLVM to equal the performance of their custom backend, but are not going to deploy the LLVM backend to production for now. They're no longer actively working on the LLVM backend, but hope to ensure it doesn't regress.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Hal Finkel is &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-October/091612.html">proposing an LLVM social in Austin on the evening of November 15th&lt;/a>.

One motivation is that some companies feel blocked from contributing due to the wording in the patent section of the LLVM developer policy, though see the linked message for a full summary. Concerns were raised about the fact that Apache 2 is incompatible with the GPLv2 and that &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-October/091642.html">license complexity may put off contributors, such as the FreeBSD community&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Robert Cox has posted an &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-October/091687.html">RFC on adding the ability for LLVM to produce an inlining report&lt;/a>. This report would give details on where inlining has taken place and why. Initial feedback is positive.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>More information for birds of a feather sessions at the upcoming LLVM dev meeting has gone out. Kristof Beyls is running one on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-October/091736.html">performance tracking and benchmarking infrastructure&lt;/a>, John Criswell on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-October/091552.html">sophisticated program analysis on LLVM IR&lt;/a>, and Paul Robinson on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-October/091546.html">living downstream without drowning&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Gaël Jobin has a &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-October/091685.html">fantastic answer&lt;/a> to a question about handling intrinsics in your backend.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Louis Brandy is a Facebook employee who is &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2015-October/045706.html">starting to work on enabling Clang module support for their C++ codebase&lt;/a>. He's interested in experiences from anyone on incrementally adding module maps to a large codebase.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A lot of work has been done to extend Clang's static analyzer to support interprocedural analysis. This thread &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2015-October/045665.html">discusses the current state and path forward&lt;/a>. It's not giving the improvement expected (in terms of detected bugs-per-second) and the thread discusses thoughts on why.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;code>TargetLowerBase::LibCall&lt;/code> LegalizeAction has been introduced.

HexagonBitSimplify continues a number of transformations to perform simplifications, redundant code elimination etc. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL250868">r250868&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The new AliasAnalysis infrastructure gained an optional 'external' AA wrapper pass, to allow users to merge in external AA results. The unit test included in the patch gives a good example of how to use this. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL250894">r250894&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>CodeGenPrepare can now transform select instructions into branches and sink expensive operands. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL250743">r250743&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Loop rotation can now use profile data in making decisions during MachineBlockPlacement. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL250754">r250754&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>ValueTracking now has a &lt;code>isKnownNonEqual&lt;/code> predicate. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL251012">r251012&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Basic (currently parsing and basic semantic analysis) support for the anticipated C++1z coroutine feature was added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL250980">r250980&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL250985">r250985&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL250993">r250993&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;code>-fvisibility=internal&lt;/code> is now aliased to &lt;code>-fvisibility=hidden&lt;/code>, as LLVM doesn't currently support internal visibility. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL250954">r250954&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang's static analyzer learnt to associate hashes with found issues.

This might mean e.g. making use of a spare bit in Value to indicate liveness. The question is whether this is something we should be looking to do in LLVM. Daniel Berlin comments that optimising these kinds of cases &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-September/090467.html">would be useful in the GVN rewrite&lt;/a>. Chris Lattner follows up with a &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-September/090499.html">sketch of how manipulation of a marker bit might be exposed&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Assert builds will now produce human-readable numbers to identify dumped SelectionDAG nodes.

As a reminder, I always welcome tips either via email or Twitter. Seeing as there's nothing new, now seems a good time to point you towards either Stephen Diehl's tutorial on &lt;a href="http://www.stephendiehl.com/llvm/">implementing a JIT compiled language with Haskell and LLVM&lt;/a> or Adrian Sampson's &lt;a href="http://adriansampson.net/blog/llvm.html">'LLVM for grad students'&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>James Knight is proposing to &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-September/090300.html">deprecate and remove the old SelectionDAG scheduler&lt;/a>, given that machine schedulers are now the preferred approach. He notes that a number of in-tree targets still use the SelectionDAG scheduler. It seems there is &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-September/090309.html">support for this plan&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Jauhien is curious about the &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-September/090120.html">availability of a C API for the ORC JIT&lt;/a>, with the motivating use case here being to provide a binding for Rust. The &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-September/090155.html">main concern&lt;/a> is that the ORC API is not yet stable, meaning it's not feasible to provide stable C bindings. The proposal is they live in llvm/include/llvm-c/unstable.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Joseph Tremoulet has a whole bunch of questions about addrspacecast semantics, and Chandler Carruth has &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-September/090180.html">a whole bunch of answers&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>David Chisnall has a &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-September/090240.html">useful response&lt;/a> to a question about implementing LLVM intrinsics with multiple return values. As he points out, this is usually done by returning a struct.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A major modification of LLVM'a alias analysis manager has landed in order to port it to the new pass manager. See the commit message for full details. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL247167">r247167&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The scalar replacement of aggregates (SROA) pass has been ported to the new pass manager. In the commit message, Chandler comments he hopes this serves as a good example of porting a transformation pass with non-trivial state to the new pass manager. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL247501">r247501&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The GlobalsModRef alias analysis pass is now enabled by default. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL247264">r247264&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Emacs users, rest your aching pinky fingers for a moment and rejoice. A range of improvements for the Emacs LLVM IR mode have landed. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL247281">r247281&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The AArch64 backend can now select STNP, the non-temporal store instruction (this hints that the value need not be kept in cache). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL247231">r247231&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Shrink wrapping optimisations are enabled on PPC64. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL247237">r247237&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A whole bunch of StringRef functions have been sprinkled with the &lt;code>ALWAYS_INLINE&lt;/code> attribute so as to reduce the overhead of string operations even on debug LLVM builds. Chandler has also been making other changes to improve the performance of check-llvm with a debug build. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL247253">r247253&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LLVM performance tips document has been extended to detail the use of allocas and when to specify alignment. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL247301">r247301&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;code>hasLoadLinkedStoreConditional&lt;/code> TargetLoweringInformation callback has now been split in to &lt;code>bool shouldExpandAtomicCmpXchgInIR(inst)&lt;/code> and &lt;code>AtomicExpansionKind shouldExpandAtomicLoadInIR(inst)&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL247429">r247429&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new control-flow integrity variant has been introduced, indirect function call chacking (enabled with &lt;code>-fsanitize=cfi-icall&lt;/code>). This checks the dynamic type of the called function matches the static type used at the call. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL247238">r247238&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new &lt;code>-analyzer-config&lt;/code> option is available to modify the size of function that the inliner considers as large. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL247463">r247463&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang will now try much harder to preserve alignment information during IR-generation. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL246985">r246985&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;code>__builtin_nontemporal_store&lt;/code> and &lt;code>__builtin_nontemporal_load&lt;/code> builtins have been introduced. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL247104">r247104&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL247374">r247374&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>libcxx gained implementations of Boyer-Moore and Boyer-Moore-Horspool searchers (for the language fundamentals technical specification). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL247036">r247036&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A trivial dynamic program linked with the new ELF lld now works with musl's dynamic linker. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL247290">r247290&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLD's COFF linker learned to merge cyclic graphs, which means self-linking now produces a 27.7MB rather than a 29.0MB executable. MSVC manages to produce a 27.1MB executable, so there is still room for improvement. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL247387">r247387&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #88, Sep 7th 2015</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/09/llvm-weekly-88-sep-7th-2015.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2015 10:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/09/llvm-weekly-88-sep-7th-2015.html</guid><description>

Congratulations to everyone involved.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The deadline for submissions to the LLVM in HPC workshop has been &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-August/089572.html">extended to Friday, September 4th&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Save the date! The next Cambridge LLVM Social will be &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-August/089650.html">on Wednesday 30th September&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Jingyue Wu has shared a &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-August/089845.html">design doc on NVPTX memory space inference&lt;/a> and on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-August/089574.html">straight-line scalar optimisations&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>An RFC from Swaroop Sridhar on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-August/089706.html">extending alloca to allow the specification of the address space of the allocation&lt;/a> has resulted in a lot of discussion and is well worth a read for those interested in the intricacies of supporting GC in LLVM. Or particular interest is this &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H5am1PyY8n8hc1hIAisDQMgbZDmMgnjU8wdN25YqMbQ/edit">design doc from Philip Reames&lt;/a> on the interaction of stack-based allocation and GC in LLVM. See also this summary from Joseph Tremoulet of &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-August/089843.html">his understanding of how LLILC is hoping to use address spaces&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>There's been some discussion on &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-August/089652.html">flaky buildbots&lt;/a>. Renato &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-August/089657.html">details his concerns with simply ignoring these bots&lt;/a>. Some of the issues with the bots in question &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-August/089753.html">may be due to the use of incremental builds&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The 'kaleidoscope' tutorial has seen a major update. Now, rather than introducing MCJIT it describes how to use ORC, building a custom JIT called KaleidoscopeJIT. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL246002">r246002&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>WebAssembly backend implementation work has been continuing over the past few weeks. The individual commits tend to be small and focused (as good commits should be). I mainly wanted to include a mention to highlight how work is ongoing. e.g. this recent commit added support for emitting simple call s-expressions. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL245986">r245986&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The documentation on statepoints now has more to say about base pointers and related assumptions and optimisations. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL246103">r246103&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Constant propagation is enabled for more single precisions math functions, such as acosf, powf, logf. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL246194">r246194&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The function &lt;code>llvm::splitCodeGen&lt;/code> has been introduced in order to support the implementation of parallel LTO code generation. It uses SplitModule to split the module in to linkable partitions that are distributed among threads to be codegenned. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL246236">r246236&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>There's been another change to DebugInfo. DISubprogram definitions must now be marked as distinct. The commit message includes a suggested script for updating IR. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL246327">r246327&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Chandler has been doing some refactoring of the ARM target parsing code with the hope of making it more efficient. He's reduced the cases where the code is called, which has a noticeable effect on some LLVM timings (e.g. check-llvm with non-optimized builds is 15 seconds faster). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL246370">r246370&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL246378">r246378&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>A NullabilityChecker has been introduced, which is designed to catch a number of nullability-related issues. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL246105">r246105&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>ThreadSanitizer is now enabled for AArch64 with 42-bit virtual addressing on Linux. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL246330">r246330&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>libcxx now contains release goals for 3.8 in its TODO.txt. This includes the Filesystem TS and the asynchronous I/O TS. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL245864">r245864&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLD's ELF linker gained a basic AMDGPU ReaderWriter that enables it to emit binaries that can be consumed by the HSA runtime. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL246155">r246155&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLD's COFF linker gained support for parallel LTO code generation. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL246342">r246342&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLDB now supports hardware watchpoints on ARM. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL245961">r245961&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The concept of 'language plugins' was introduced to LLDB. These will provide language-specific data formatters or expression evaluation. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL246212">r246212&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #86, Aug 24th 2015</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/08/llvm-weekly-86-aug-24th-2015.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2015 02:56:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/08/llvm-weekly-86-aug-24th-2015.html</guid><description>

This gives a speedup on a HP Z620 from 15m20s to 8m06s when 4 partitions are used. Speedup beyond that is limited (partially due to Amdahl's law).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Sanjoy Day has shared an RFC for &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-August/089070.html">adding operand bundles to call and invokes&lt;/a>. These would be used to help track state required for deoptimization, for instance by attaching a 'deopt' operand bundle to relevant calls which contans the cstate of the abstract virtual machine.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>MergeFunctions has been sped up substantially by hashing functions and comparing that hash before performing a full comparison.

A later commit documented this syntax. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL244982">r244982&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL245138">r245138&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new TargetTransformInfo hook has been added for specifying per-target defaults for interleaved accesses. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL244449">r244449&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The llvm.loop.unroll.enable metadata was introduced. This will cause a loop to be unrolled fully if the trip count is known at compiler time and partially if it isn't (unlike llvm.loop.unroll.full which won't unroll a loop if the trip count isn't known). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL244466">r244466&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Rudimentary support for the new Windows exception handling instructions has been introduced. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL244558">r244558&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Token types have been added to LLVM IR. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL245029">r245029&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The BPF backend gained documentation and an instruction set description. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL245105">r245105&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul> &lt;li>&lt;p>The WebKit brace style is now supported by clang-format. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL244446">r244446&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul> &lt;li>&lt;p>Statistics collection in the OpenMP runtime has been tidied up and expanded. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL244677">r244677&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #84, Aug 10th 2015</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/08/llvm-weekly-84-aug-10th-2015.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2015 05:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/08/llvm-weekly-84-aug-10th-2015.html</guid><description>

It's titled LLVM for Grad Students, but it should be useful for anybody looking to use LLVM or just wanting to understand it better.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Brandon Holt has written up a short and helpful post giving &lt;a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bholt/posts/llvm-debugging.html">hints and tips on debugging LLVM&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The move of the mailing lists from UIUC on to lists.llvm.org is now complete. All public LLVM-related mailing lists &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo">are shown here&lt;/a>. List addresses have now changed to listname@lists.llvm.org.&lt;/p>&lt;p>There's been some exciting activity in the world of GCC. Support for the draft C++ Concepts TS &lt;a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commit;h=56c12fd4ba064759724236ad896232603b8797ed">has been committed&lt;/a>. A draft of the technical specification is &lt;a href="http://www.open-std.org/Jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4377.pdf">available here&lt;/a>. Additionally, Nick Clifton has posted a useful summary of &lt;a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2015-08/msg00013.html">GNU toolchain developments for July/August&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Rong Xu has shared an &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-August/089044.html">RFC for late instrumentation in LLVM&lt;/a>. The RFC describes (and quantifies) the performance cost of inserting instrumentation for profile-guided optimisation in the frontend and proposes approaches for adding instrumentation in the middle-end instead.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Jingyue Wu kicked off a discussion about &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-August/089023.html">modifying the BasicAA alias analysis to understand whether there is aliasing between different address spaces&lt;/a>. &lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Teresa Johnson has posted RFCs for the &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-August/088920.html">ThinLTO file API and data structures&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-August/088916.html">ThinLTO file format&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Chandler Carruth is looking to enable the GlobalModsRef in the default pass pipeline. He's found it performance neutral in his tests so far, but would &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-August/088988.html">appreciate more people to try and benchmark it&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Asking for advice on how to get started with LLVM is very common. Few take as much time on detailing their background, motivations, and proposed plan as &lt;a href="http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2015-August/088915.html">Arno Bastenhof in a recent message&lt;/a>. Probably because of this, his request has attracted some very high quality replies.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A handy new LLVM Support header was introduced. The TrailingObjects template class abstracts away &lt;code>reinterpret_cast&lt;/code>, pointer arithmetic, and size calculation needed for the case where a class has some other objects appended to the end of it. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL244164">r244164&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Initial documentation for the Machine IR serialization format has been written. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL244292">r244292&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Uniquable DICompilerUnits have been disallowed. Old bitcode will be automatically upgraded and the sed script in the commit message should be useful for updating out-of-tree testcases. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL243885">r243885&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>All of the TargetTransformInfo cost APIs now use int rather than unsigned. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL244080">r244080&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new checker for code-level localizability issues on OSX/iOS was born. It will warn about the use of non-localized NSStrings passed to UI methods and about failing to include a comment in NSLocalizedString macros.&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL244389">r244389&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>New AST matchers have been introduced for constructors that are default, copy, or move. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL244036">r244036&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The old COFF linker in LLD has been removed in favour of the new, faster, and simpler implementation. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL244226">r244226&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>ThreadSanitizer is now enabled for AArch64. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL244055">r244055&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #83, Aug 3rd 2015</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/08/llvm-weekly-83-aug-3rd-2015.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2015 06:21:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/08/llvm-weekly-83-aug-3rd-2015.html</guid><description>

The &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2015-04/slides/Clang_static_analysis_toolset_final.pdf">slides&lt;/a> from the talk at EuroLLVM earlier this year give a good overview.&lt;/p>&lt;p>LLVM/Clang 3.7 RC2 &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/44237">has been tagged&lt;/a>.

See also the associated paper &lt;a href="https://www.sstic.org/media/SSTIC2015/SSTIC-actes/control_flow_integrity_on_llvm_ir/SSTIC2015-Article-control_flow_integrity_on_llvm_ir-fontaine_chifflier_coudray_esfrDAl.pdf">Picon: Control Flow Integrity on LLVM IR&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>There is a plan to &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/88947">jump to Windows 7 as the baseline requirement for LLVM&lt;/a>, which has been featured in LLVM Weekly previously many months ago. If such a move would cause a problem for you, now is the time to speak up. There's also a proposal to &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/88959">drop support for the old mingw.org toolchains&lt;/a> in favour of the maintained mingw-w64.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>James Molloy has prototyped &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/D11530">LoopEditor&lt;/a>, a high-level API for loop transformations in LLVM and is &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.cvs/260989">seeking additional feedback&lt;/a>. The hope is that existing loop transformations could be rewritten and simplified to use it.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Easwaran Raman has shared an &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/88929">RFC on speedup estimation for inlining cost analysis&lt;/a>.

The proposal generated quite a lot of discussion.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Juergen Ributzka kicked off a discussion on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/88334">improving the maintenance and management of the LLVM C API&lt;/a>. Eric Christopher &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/88357">suggests moving the C API to another project&lt;/a>, so those who want/require a stable API can take on the burden of keeping it up to date. He &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/88413">elaborates on his proposal&lt;/a> in response from Chris Lattner. There seems to be &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/88420">some support&lt;/a> for providing C bindings with the same stability guarantees as the C++ API (i.e. it might break between major releases).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Hal Finkel has proposed an &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/88200">RFC on defining infinite loops in LLVM&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The API to determine callee-save registers has been rewritten. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL242165">r242165&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The 'debugger tuning' concept has been introduced, allowing the specification of the debugger the debug info should be optimised for. This defaults to lldb on OS X and FreeBSD and GDB for everything else (other than PS4, which defaults to the SCE debugger). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL242388">r242388&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Intrinsics for absolute difference operations have been introduced. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL242409">r242409&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The PostRAScheduler has been disabled for the Apple Swift CPU and MachineScheduler is used in place. The commit message argues PostRAScheduler is not a good fit for out-of-order architectures and suggests the same switch might be worth while for other ARM OoO CPUs. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL242500">r242500&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for armv7-windows-gnu targets has been added to the Clang front-end. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL242292">r242292&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The clang module container format is now selectable from the command line (raw or obj). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL242499">r242499&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A minimal AMDGPU toolchain configuration has been added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL242601">r242601&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLD now supports MIPS big-endian targets. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL242014">r242014&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLDB's gdbserver is moving towards being a single-threaded application. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL242018">r242018&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The OpenMP CMake build system has been massively refactored. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL242298">r242298&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #80, Jul 13th 2015</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/07/llvm-weekly-80-jul-13th-2015.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2015 09:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/07/llvm-weekly-80-jul-13th-2015.html</guid><description>

This is intended to be target independent. As described at the top of BitTracker.cpp, this is intended to be used with a target-specific machine instruction evaluator. There have been some other large additions to the Hexagon backend this week too. I hope the authors will consider given another talk on their work at some point.&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL241595">r241595&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>llc learnt the &lt;code>run-pass&lt;/code> option, which will run one specific code generation pass only. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL241476">r241476&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM now has documentation on its inline assembly!&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL241698">r241698&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The llvm.frameescape and llvm.framerecover intrinsics have been renamed to localescape and localrecover. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL241463">r241463&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Various refactoring commits have been made with the aim of having a single DataLayout used during compilation, owned by the module.&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL241775">r241775&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new llvm.canonicalize intrinsics has been introduced, intended to be used to canonicalize floating point values. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL241977">r241977&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The new argmemonly attribute can be used to mark functions that can only access memory through its argument pointers. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL241979">r241979&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A few patches landed in Clang improving Objective-C support. This includes parsing, semantic analysis, and AST support for Objective-C type parameters, support for Objective-C type arguments, the &lt;code>__kindof&lt;/code> type qualifier. Douglas Gregor has more to say about these changes &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/43614">on the mailing list&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL241541">r241541&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL241542">r241542&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL241548">r241548&lt;/a>, and more.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang will attached the readonly or readnone attributes when appropriate to inline assembly instructions, meaning the inline asm will not be treated as conservatively. e.g. in some cases an inline asm block could be hoisted out of a loop. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL241930">r241930&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>PCH (pre-compiled headers) are now wrapped in an object file. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL241690">r241690&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL241620">r241620&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang now recognises the GCC-compatible &lt;code>-fprofile-generate&lt;/code> and &lt;code>-fprofile-use&lt;/code> flags. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL241825">r241825&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>libcxx add &lt;code>try_emplace&lt;/code> and &lt;code>insert_or_assign&lt;/code> to &lt;code>map&lt;/code> and &lt;code>unordered_map&lt;/code>, as specified in &lt;a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4279">N4279&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL241539">r241539&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The new LLD COFF linker now has basic support for x86 (it was previously x86-64 only). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL241857">r241857&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #79, Jul 6th 2015</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/07/llvm-weekly-79-jul-6th-2015.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2015 16:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/07/llvm-weekly-79-jul-6th-2015.html</guid><description>

It is a statically typed language with syntax inspired by Ruby which (of course) compiles using LLVM. It was &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9669166">discussed last week on Hacker News&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>icGrep has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/86599">been released&lt;/a>.

Congratulations to the winner, Karen Pease, for creating such a monstrous piece of code.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Chandler Carruth has posted a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/86607">summary of a recent in-person discussion about LLD's future and design&lt;/a>. It looks like this was a very positive meeting with agreement in important areas. The recently contributed experimental COFF linker is going to be evaluated to see if its linking model would be appropriate for Darwin. If so, the hope is work can focus on adopting that as the standard model. If not, more work will need to be done on refactoring LLD and making sure that code which makes sense to be shared is.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Christos Margiolas has been working as an intern at the Qualcomm Innovation Center on support for heterogeneous compute, including transparent offloading of loops or functions to accelerators. He is &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/86569">asking for feedback&lt;/a> and looking to see if there is interest in getting this upstream. He has &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5GasMlWJhTOb2tXTDZsal9qclE/view">shared a slide deck&lt;/a> which gives more details.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Woodrow Barlow is interested in &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/86373">implementing a new PIC backend for LLVM&lt;/a>.

It was pointed out that the LLVM loop reroll pass should be helpful for this, but it does need to run on an existing loop.

Alex Rosenberg gave a good &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/85247">summary of the original aims of LLD&lt;/a> and how recent changes have moved it further from those aims.

In it, he proposes some major changes that would hopefully ease the path to LLD becoming a fully functional ELF, Mach-O, and PE-COFF linker. The two main proposals are to use the 'section' rather than the 'atom' model and to stop trying to bend the Unix model to work on other platforms, instead directly implementing the necessary native behaviour. There are understandably some concerns that this direction could result in LLD having to maintain essentially three linkers, but discussion is ongoing and much feedback seems positive.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Alex, who will be interning at Apple this summer has posted an &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/85003">RFC on a proposed machine level IR text serialisation format&lt;/a>. It came out a little mangled on Gmane so you may prefer to read the &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2015-April/084932.html">pipermail rendering&lt;/a>. A lot of the feedback revolves around the pros and cons of a YAML-based format..&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Andrey Bokhanko suggests &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/42449">replacing libgomp with libiomp&lt;/a> as the default OpenMP runtime library when using &lt;code>-fopenmp&lt;/code>. Ultimately there seems to be agreement and the only issue seems to be on the library naming.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Nico Weber reports that although &lt;code>-gline-tables-only&lt;/code> makes debug info much smaller, they've &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/42419">found with Chromium the resulting stackframes aren't that usable without function parameters and namespaces&lt;/a>. The proposal is to add a new variant that does include function parameter info and namespace info.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LLVM performance tips document has gained another two entries. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL235825">r235825&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL235826">r235826&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>llvm-symbolizer now works on Windows. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL235900">r235900&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>SelectionDAG, DAGCombiner and codegen support for masked scatter and gather has been added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL235970">r235970&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL236211">r236211&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL236394">r236394&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Debug locations have been added to all constant SelectionDAG nodes. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL235989">r235989&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Dragonegg support has been dropped from the release script. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL236077">r236077&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The debug info IR constructs have been renamed from &lt;code>MD*&lt;/code> to &lt;code>DI*&lt;/code>.

While a number of the OSS projects already targeted LLVM BitCode, no one had anything that was a close match for the CoreCLR interface. Looking at our options it was simplest for us to refactor a working MSIL reader to target BitCode then teach a existing project to support the contracts and APIs the CoreCLR uses for JITing MSIL. Using a existing MSIL reader let us quickly start using a number of building-block components that we think the community can take advantage of. This fast bootstrap for C# across multiple platforms was the idea that was the genesis of this project and the compelling reason to start a new effort. We hope LLILC will provide a useful example - and reusable components - for the community and make it easier for other projects to interoperate with the CoreCLR runtime.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;h4 id="why-llvm-" style="-webkit-font-feature-settings: 'dlig' 1, 'liga' 1, 'lnum' 1, 'kern' 1; box-sizing: border-box; color: #373d49; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.5625rem; line-height: 28px; margin-bottom: 0.54686rem; margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 0.45314rem;">&lt;span style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">Why LLVM?&lt;/span>&lt;/h4>&lt;div style="-webkit-font-feature-settings: 'kern' 1, 'onum' 1, 'liga' 1; box-sizing: border-box; color: #373d49; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 28px; margin-bottom: 1.33999rem; padding-top: 0.66001rem;">&lt;span style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">Basically we think LLVM is awesome.

Getting started with translating to BitCode has been a very straightforward experience and ramp-up time for someone with compiler experience has been very quick. The MCJIT, which we started with for our JIT, was easy to configure and get code compiled and returned to the runtime. Outside of the COFF issue discussed below, we only had to make adjustments in configuration or straightforward overrides of classes, like EEMemoryManager, to enable working code. Of the caveats, the first was simple, but the other two are going to require sustained work to bring up to the level we'd like. The first issue was a problem with Windows support in the DynamicRuntime of the MCJIT infrastructure. The last two, Precise Garbage Collection, and Exception Handling, arise because of the different semantics of managed languages. Luckily for us, people in the community have already started working in these areas so we don't have to start from zero.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;h4 id="coff-dynamic-loader-support" style="-webkit-font-feature-settings: 'dlig' 1, 'liga' 1, 'lnum' 1, 'kern' 1; box-sizing: border-box; color: #373d49; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.5625rem; line-height: 28px; margin-bottom: 0.54686rem; margin-top: 0px; padding-top: 0.45314rem;">&lt;span style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">COFF dynamic loader support&lt;/span>&lt;/h4>&lt;div style="-webkit-font-feature-settings: 'kern' 1, 'onum' 1, 'liga' 1; box-sizing: border-box; color: #373d49; font-family: Georgia, Cambria, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 28px; margin-bottom: 1.33999rem; padding-top: 0.66001rem;">&lt;span style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">One of the additions we made to LLVM to unblock ourselves was to implement a COFF dynamic loader.

Clang however is more than just a lexer and giving it random bytes barely scratches the surface, so in addition to testing with random bytes we also fuzzed Clang in &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#tokens">token-aware mode&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">.&amp;nbsp;Both modes found &lt;a href="https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=23057">bugs&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">; some of them were previously &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/cfe-dev/2015-January/040705.html">detected &lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/cfe-dev/2015-January/040705.html">by AFL&lt;/a>, some others were not: we’ve run this fuzzer with AddressSanitizer and some of the bugs are not easily discoverable without it.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Just to give you the feeling, here are some of the input samples discovered by the token-aware clang-fuzzer starting from an empty test corpus: &lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &amp;nbsp;static void g(){}&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &amp;nbsp;signed*Qwchar_t;&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &amp;nbsp;overridedouble++!=~;inline-=}y=^bitand{;*=or;goto*&amp;amp;&amp;amp;k}==n&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &amp;nbsp;int XS/=~char16_t&amp;amp;s&amp;lt;=const_cast&amp;lt;Xchar*&amp;gt;(thread_local3+=char32_t &lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Fuzzing is not a one-off thing -- it shines when used continuously. We have set up a &lt;a href="http://lab.llvm.org:8011/builders/sanitizer-x86_64-linux-fuzzer">public build bot&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> that runs clang-fuzzer and clang-format-fuzzer 24/7. This way, the fuzzers keep improving the test corpus and will periodically find old bugs or fresh regressions (the bot has &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/D7871">caught&lt;/a> at least one such regression already&lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">). &lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The benefit of in-process fuzzing compared to out-of-process is that you can test more inputs per second. This is also a weakness: you can not effectively limit the execution time for every input. If some of the inputs trigger superlinear behavior, it may slow down or paralyze the fuzzing. Our fuzzing bot was nearly dead after it discovered &lt;a href="https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=23052#c3">exponential parsing time in clang-format&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. You can workaround the problem by setting a timeout for the fuzzer, but it’s always better to fix superlinear behavior.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It would be interesting to fuzz other parts of LLVM, but a requirement for in-process fuzzing is that the library does not crash on invalid inputs. This holds for clang and clang-format, but not for, e.g., the LLVM bitcode reader. &lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Help is more than welcome! You can start by fixing one of the existing bugs in clang or clang-format (see &lt;a href="https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=23057">PR23057&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=23052">PR23052&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="http://sli.dy.fi/~sliedes/clang-triage/triage_report.xhtml">results from AFL&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> or write your own fuzzer for some other part of LLVM or profile one of the existing fuzzers and try to make it faster by fixing performance bugs. &lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Of course, LibFuzzer can be used to test things outside of the LLVM project. As an example, and following &lt;a href="https://blog.hboeck.de/archives/868-How-Heartbleed-couldve-been-found.html">Hanno Böck’s blog post&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">, we’ve applied LibFuzzer to &lt;a href="https://www.openssl.org/">openssl&lt;/a> &lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">and found Heartbleed in &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#heartbleed">less than a minute&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">.

We encourage everyone to start actively fuzz testing their interfaces, especially those with even a small chance of being subject to attacker-controlled inputs. We hope the LLVM fuzzing library helps you start leveraging our tools to better test your code, and let us know about any truly exciting bugs they help you find!&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #66, Apr 6th 2015</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/04/llvm-weekly-66-apr-6th-2015.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2015 02:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/04/llvm-weekly-66-apr-6th-2015.html</guid><description>

I am biased, but I'd like to draw particular attention to the wide variety of &lt;a href="http://www.lowrisc.org/docs/gsoc-2015-ideas/">lowRISC GSoC ideas&lt;/a>, including a project to implement an LLVM pass using tagged memory to provide protection against control-flow hijacking.&lt;/p>&lt;p>GCC 5 is starting to &lt;a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2015-03/msg00241.html">get near to release&lt;/a>. The first release candidate is expected in the first week of April.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Peter Collingbourne has kicked off a thread on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/41832">controlling the LTO optimization level&lt;/a>. Using LTO can cause a massive increase in compile-time. Peter argues that for some features, like the recently added control flow integrity checks in Clang, you require LTO for whole program visibility but perhaps would rather do much fewer optimisations in order to get a more reasonable compile time. He proposes a &lt;code>-flto-level&lt;/code> command line option.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Eric Christopher has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/83858">written to the mailing list&lt;/a> about recent changes he's made to the TargetMachine::getSubtarget API.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Dario Domizioli proposes &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/83665">adding target-specific defaults for options in the LLVM tools&lt;/a>. Response was mostly negative on the grounds that opt, llc, and friends are tools meant for LLVM developers rather than end-users. Sean Silva attempted to &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/83746">clarify the difference between LLVM users, LLVM end-users, and LLVM developers&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The backend for the Hexagon DSP has continued to grow over the past few weeks. Most recently, support for vector instructions has been added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL232728">r232728&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LLVM developer documentation grew guidance on writing commit messages. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL232334">r232334&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM learnt to support the ARMv6k target. The commit message has a handy ascii art diagram to explain its position in the ARM family. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL232468">r232468&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The size of a Release+Asserts clang binary has been reduced by ~400k by devirtualising Attr and its subclasses. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL232726">r232726&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Work on MS ABI continues, with support for HandlerMap entries for C++ catch. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL232538">r232538&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new warning, &lt;code>-Wpartial-ability&lt;/code> will warn when using decls that are not available on all deployment targets. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL232750">r232750&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>C++14 sized deallocation has been disabled default due to compatibility issues. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL232788">r232788&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Performance of a self-hosted lld link has again been improved. It's now down to 3 seconds on the patch author's machine (vs 5 seconds before, and 8 seconds for the GNU BFD linker). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL232460">r232460&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>libcxx gained the &lt;code>&amp;lt;experimental/tuple&amp;gt;&lt;/code> header which implements most of the tuple functionality specified in the library fundamentals TS. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL232515">r232515&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLD now supports the semantics of simple sections mappings in linker scripts and can handle symbols defined in them. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL232402">r232402&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL232409">r232409&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Mips64 lldb gained an initial assembly profiler. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL232619">r232619&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #63, Mar 16th 2015</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/03/llvm-weekly-63-mar-16th-2015.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 08:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/03/llvm-weekly-63-mar-16th-2015.html</guid><description>

The issue is due to the fact an unreachable block is generated with ill-formed instruction, and there is a lot of follow on discussion about whether passes should generate unreachable blocks.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Dibyendu Majumdar wrote to the list to &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/82698">ask about issues eliminating redundant loads&lt;/a>.

We've spoken in the &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/clangllvm-on-windows-update.html">past&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;about teaching Clang to fully support Windows and be compatible with MSVC. &amp;nbsp;Until now, a big missing piece in this story has been debugging the clang-generated executables. &amp;nbsp;Over the past 6 months, we've started working on making LLDB work well on Windows and support debugging both regular Windows programs and those produced by Clang.&lt;br />&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Why not use an existing debugger such as GDB, Visual Studio's, or WinDBG? &amp;nbsp;There are a lot of factors in making this kind of decision. &amp;nbsp;For example, while GDB understands the DWARF debug information produced by Clang on Windows, it doesn't understand the Microsoft C++ ABI or debug information format. &amp;nbsp;On the other hand, neither Visual Studio nor WinDBG understand the DWARF debug information produced by Clang. &amp;nbsp;With LLDB, we can teach it to support &lt;i>both&lt;/i> of these formats, making it usable with a wider range of programs. &amp;nbsp;There are also other reasons why we're really excited to work on LLDB for Windows, such as the tight integration with Clang which lets it support all of the same C++ features in its expression parser that Clang supports in your source code. &amp;nbsp;We're also looking to continue adding new functionality to the debugging experience going forward, and having an open source debugger that is part of the larger LLVM project makes this really easy.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>The past few months have been spent porting LLDB's core codebase to Windows. &amp;nbsp;We've been fixing POSIX assumptions, enhancing the OS abstraction layer, and removing platform specific system calls from generic code. &amp;nbsp;Sometimes we have needed to take on significant refactorings to build abstractions where they are necessary to support platform specific differences. &amp;nbsp;We have also worked to port the test infrastructure to Windows and set up build bots to ensure things stay green.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>This preliminary bootstraping work is mostly complete, and you can use LLDB to debug simple executables generated with Clang on Windows today. &amp;nbsp;Note the use of the word "simple". &amp;nbsp;At last check, approximately 50% of LLDB's tests fail on Windows. &amp;nbsp;Our baseline, however, which is a single 32-bit executable (i.e. no shared libraries), single-threaded application built and linked with Clang and LLD using DWARF debug information, works today. &amp;nbsp;We've tested all of the fundamental functionality such as:&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;ol>&lt;li>Various methods of setting breakpoints (address, source file+line, symbol name, etc)&lt;/li>&lt;li>Stopping at and continuing from breakpoints&lt;/li>&lt;li>Process inspection while stopped, such as stack unwinding, frame setting, memory examination, local variables, expression evaluation, stepping, etc &amp;nbsp;(one notable exception to this is that step-over doesn't yet work well in the presence of limited symbol information).&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;div>Of course, there is still more to be done. &amp;nbsp;Here are some of the areas we're planning to work on next:&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;ol>&lt;li>Fixing low hanging fruit by improving the pass-rate of the test suite.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Better support for debugging multi-threaded applications.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Support for debugging crash dumps.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Support for debugging x64 binaries.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Enabling stepping through shared libraries.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Understanding PDB (for debugging system libraries, and executables generated with MSVC). &amp;nbsp;Although the exact format of PDB is undocumented, Microsoft still provides a rich API for querying PDB in the form of the DIA SDK.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Adding debugging commands familiar to users of WinDBG (e.g. !handle, !peb, etc)&lt;/li>&lt;li>Remote debugging&lt;/li>&lt;li>Symbol server support&lt;/li>&lt;li>Visual Studio integration&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;div>If you're using Clang on Windows, we would encourage you to &lt;a href="http://lldb.llvm.org/build.html#BuildingLldbOnWindows">build LLDB&lt;/a> (it should be in the Windows &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/builds/">LLVM installer&lt;/a> soon) and let us know your thoughts by posting them to &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/lldb-dev">lldb-dev&lt;/a>. &amp;nbsp;Make sure you &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=lldb">file bugs&lt;/a> against LLDB if you notice anything wrong, and we would love for you to dive into the code and help out. &amp;nbsp;If you see something wrong, dig in and try to fix it, and post your patch to &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/lldb-commits">lldb-commits&lt;/a>.&lt;/div>&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #55, Jan 19th 2015</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/01/llvm-weekly-55-jan-19th-2015.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2015 09:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/01/llvm-weekly-55-jan-19th-2015.html</guid><description>

Due to travel etc and the volume of traffic, I haven't been able to do much summarisation of mailing list discussion I'm afraid.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/55">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>LLM/Clang 3.6 &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80665">has been branched&lt;/a> and subsequently, 3.6 RC1 &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/40736">has been tagged&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>LLVM/Clang 3.5.1 seems to have been &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.5.1">quietly released&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Registration for &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2015-04/">EuroLLVM 2015&lt;/a>, to be held at Goldsmiths College in London, UK on April 13-14th is &lt;a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/eurollvm-2015-tickets-15350278095">now open&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>All slides and videos from the last LLVM Developers' meeting are &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/">now live&lt;/a>, including those from Apple employees.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Ahmed Bougacha has posted an &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80678">RFC on adding integer saturation intrinsics&lt;/a> to LLVM. There are various questions in the ensuing thread about whether adding an intrisc is necessary and the best way to go about this. i.e. whether it is possible to just pattern match later on in the compilation flow.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>In response to a question about using LLDB when attached to a system that may switch between AARch32 and AArch64, Colin Riley has written a good description of &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.lldb.devel/6184">current support and potential future support for multiple targets in one debugger session&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Jonathan Ragan-Kelley &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80499">asks about emitting IR in older formats&lt;/a> due to a requirement to emit 3.2-compatible bitcode for Nvidia's libNVVM. Several replies suggest looking at SPIR.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Do you wonder what the difference is between the multiple ways of querying operation costs? &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80705">Wonder no more&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Duncan P.N. Exon Smith has posted on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80563">RFC on first-class debug info in IR&lt;/a>. There have been a few changes since the previous proposal.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Chandler Carruth has written a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80841">summary of alias analysis pass ordering in LLVM and Clang&lt;/a>. This details both the current situation as well as Chandler's views on how it should change in the future.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Philip Reames is seeking wider feedback on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80849/">two implementation issues for GCStrategy&lt;/a>. The two key questions are whether GC-specific properties should be checked in the IR verifier and what the access model for GCStrategy should be. No responses yet, so now is the time to dive in.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Ramshankar Ramanarayanan has posted a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80798">proof of concept for a loop fusion pass&lt;/a>.

The aim is to cleanly support a wider range of JIT uses cases, and to be clear this higher level API would not replace the existing MCJIT.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Bjoern Haase has been spending some time examining generated code for armv6 microcontroller targets such as the Cortex M0. He has a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80497">series of suggestions for tweaking default optimizer settings for this target&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new code diversity feature is now available. The NoopInsertion pass will add random no-ops to x86 binaries to try to make ROP attacks more difficult by increasing diversity. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL225908">r225908&lt;/a>. I highly recommend reading up on the &lt;a href="http://www.scs.stanford.edu/brop/">blind ROP&lt;/a> attack published last year. It would also be interesting to see an implementation of &lt;a href="http://seclab.tuwien.ac.at/papers/gfree.pdf">G-Free&lt;/a> for producing binaries without simple gadgets. The commit was later reverted for some reason.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A nice summary of recent MIPS and PowerPC target developments, as well as the OCaml bindings is now there in the form of the 3.6 release notes. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL225607">r225607&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL225695">r225695&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL225779">r225779&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM learned the llvm.frameallocate and llvm.framerecover intrinsics, which allow multiple functions to share a single stack allocation from one function's call frame. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL225746">r225746&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL225752">r225752&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>An experimental (disabled by default) 'inductive range check elimination' pass has landed.

I'm in SF Fri-Sun and somewhat free on the Saturday if anyone wants to meet and chat LLVM or lowRISC/RISC-V.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/54">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Euro LLVM 2015 will be held on April 13th-14th in London, UK. The &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80291">call for papers&lt;/a> is now open with a deadline of 16th Feb.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Talks for the &lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/track/llvm_toolchain/">LLVM devroom at FOSDEM&lt;/a>have been announced. The LLVM devroom is on Sunday 1st Feb. Readers will be pleased to know this doesn't clash with &lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/lowrisc/">my talk on lowRISC&lt;/a> which is on the Saturday.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Google now use &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2015/01/using-clang-for-chrome-production.html">Clang for production Chrome builds on Linux&lt;/a>. They were previously using GCC 4.6. Compared to that baseline, performance stayed roughly the same while binary size decreased by 8%. It would certainly have been interesting to compare to a more recent GCC baseline. The blog post indicates they're hopeful to use Clang in the future for building Chrome for Windows.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Philip Reames did an interesting back of the envelope calculation about the &lt;a href="http://www.philipreames.com/Blog/2015/01/10/how-much-does-it-cost-to-maintain-llvm/">cost of maintaining LLVM&lt;/a>. He picked out commits which seems like they could be trivially automated and guesstimated a cost based on developer time. The figure he arrives at is $1400 per month.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The next LLVM social for Cambridge, UK will be &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80341">on Wed 21st Jan at 7:30pm&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM 3.6 will be &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80447">branching soon&lt;/a>, on 14th January.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Philip Reames asks &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80355">whether address space 1 is reserved on any architecture&lt;/a>. It seems the answer is no, though the thread resulted in some discussion on the use of address spaces and the ability to reserve some. Philip &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80370">had a strawman proposal&lt;/a> for meanings of different address space numbers.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Chandler Carruth has suggested &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80430">new IR features are needed to represent the cases global metadata is currently used for&lt;/a>. Metadata was intended to be used to hold information that can be safely dropped, though this isn't true for e.g. module flags.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Arch Robinson kicked off a discussion about &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80381">floating point range checks in LLVM&lt;/a>. This isn't currently supported, though there's agreement it could be useful as well as a fair amount of discussion on some of the expected subtleties.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>If you're wondering about alias instructions, Bruce Hoult has a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80402">good explanation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Note to out-of-tree backend maintainers, &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80385">get/setLoadExtAction now takes another parameter&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Right now, LLDB will compile entered expressions in C++ mode. As &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.lldb.devel/6141">noted on the lldb mailing list&lt;/a> this can be problematic when e.g. debugging a C function which has a local variable called 'this'. Greg Clayton &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.lldb.devel/6142">points out how helpful supporting C++ expressions can be&lt;/a>, even when debugging C code.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A thread about the &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80418">design of the new pass manager&lt;/a> has been revived.

&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">Chrome 38 was released early October 2014. It is the first release where the Linux binaries shipped to users are built by clang. Previously, this was done by gcc 4.6. As you can read in the &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/cfe-dev/2014-November/039929.html">announcement email&lt;/a>, the switch happened without many issues. Performance stayed roughly the same, binary size decreased by about 8%. In this post I'd like to discuss the motivation for this switch.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">Motivation&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">There are two reasons for the switch.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">1. Many Chromium developers already used clang on Linux. We've supported &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/Clang">opting in&lt;/a> to clang for since &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2011-11/Weber_Wennborg_UsingClangInChromium.pdf">before clang supported C++&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;– because of this, we have a process in place for shipping new clang binaries to all developers and bots every few weeks. Because of clang's good diagnostics (&lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/cfe-commits/Week-of-Mon-20110530/042515.html">some&lt;/a> of &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/cfe-commits/Week-of-Mon-20120227/054412.html">which&lt;/a> we &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/cfe-commits/Week-of-Mon-20110613/042785.html">added&lt;/a> due to bugs in Chromium we thought the compiler should catch), speed, and because of our &lt;a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/coding-style/chromium-style-checker-errors">Chromium-specific clang plugin&lt;/a>, many Chromium developers switched to clang over the years. Making clang the default compiler removes a stumbling block for people new to the project.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">2. We want to use modern C++ features in Chromium. This requires a recent toolchain – we figured we needed at least gcc 4.8. For Chrome for Android and Chrome for Chrome OS, we updated our gcc compilers to 4.8 (and then 4.9) – easy since these ports use a non-system gcc already. Chrome for Mac has been using Chromium's clang since Chrome 15 and was already in a good state. Chrome for iOS uses Xcode 5's clang, which is also new enough. Chrome for Windows uses Visual Studio 2013 Update 4. On Linux, switching to clang was the easiest way forward.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">Keeping up with C++'s evolution in a large, multi-platform project&lt;/h3>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">C++ had been static for many years. C++11 is the first real update to the C++ language since the original C++ standard (approved on July 27 1998). C++98 predated the founding of Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, the releases of Mac OS X and Windows XP, and x86 SSE instructions. The time between the two standards saw the rise and fall of the iPod, several waves of social networks, and the smartphone explosion.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">The time between C++11 and C++14 was three years, and the next major iteration of the language is speculated to be finished in 2017, three years from C++14. This is a dramatic change, and it has repercussions on how to build and ship C++ programs. It took us 3+ years to get to a state where we can use C++11 in Chromium; C++14 will hopefully take us less long. (If you're targeting fewer platforms, you'll have an easier time.)&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">There are two parts to C++11: New language features, and new library features. The language features just require a modern compiler at build time on build machines, the library features need a new standard library at runtime on the user's machine.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">Deploying a new compiler is conceptually relatively simple. If your developers are on Ubuntu LTS releases and you make them use the newest LTS release, they get new compilers every two years – so just using the default system compiler means you're up to two years behind. There needs to be some process to relatively transparently deploy new toolchains to your developers – an "evergreen compiler". We now have this in place for Chromium – on Linux, by using clang. (We still accept patches to keep Chromium buildable with gccs &amp;gt;= 4.8 for people who prefer compiling locally over using precompiled binaries, and we still use gcc as the target compiler for Chrome for Android and Chrome OS.)&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">The library situation is slightly more tricky: On Linux and Mac OS X, programs are usually linked against the system C++ library. Chrome wants to support Mac OS X 10.6 a bit longer (our users seem to love this OS X release), and the only C++ library this ships with is libstdc++ 4.2 – which doesn't have any C++11 bits. Similarly, Ubuntu Precise only has libstdc++ 4.6. It seems that with C++ updating more often, products will have to either stop supporting older OS versions (even if they still have many users on these old versions), adopt new C++ features very slowly, or ship with a bundled C++ standard library. The latter implies that system libraries shouldn't have a C++ interface for ABI reasons – luckily, this is mostly already the case.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">To make things slightly more complicated, gcc and libstdc++ expect to be updated at the same time. gcc 4.8 links to libstdc++ 4.8, so upgrading gcc 4.8 while still linking to Precise's libstdc++ 4.6 isn't easy. clang &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/cfe-commits/Week-of-Mon-20140630/109151.html">explicitly supports&lt;/a> building with older libstdc++ versions.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">For Chromium, we opted to enable C++11 language features now, and then allow C++11 library features later once we have figured out the story there. This allows us to &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/chromium-dev/xMscQuYBwyc">incrementally adopt&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://chromium-cpp.appspot.com/">C++11 features in Chromium&lt;/a>,&amp;nbsp;but it's not without risks:&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; v0{42}&lt;/span> for example means something different with an old C++ library and a new C++ library that has a &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">vector&lt;/span> constructor taking an &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">initializer_list&lt;/span>. We disallow using uniform initialization for now because of this.&lt;br />&lt;br />Since bundling a C++ library seems to become more common with this new C++ update cadence, it would be nice if compiler drivers helped with this. Just statically linking libstdc++ / libc++ isn't enough if you're shipping a product consisting of several executables or shared libraries – they need to dynamically link to a shared C++ library with the right rpaths, the C++ library probably needs mangled symbol names that don't conflict with the system C++ library which might be loaded into the same process due to other system libraries using it internally (for example, maybe using an inline namespace with an application-specific name), etc.&lt;br />&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;">Future directions&lt;/h3>As mentioned above, we're trying to figure out the C++ library situation. The tricky cases are Chrome for Android (which currently uses STLport) and Chrome for Mac. We're hoping to switch Chrome for Android to libc++ (while still using gcc as compiler). On Mac, we'll likely bundle libc++ with Chrome too.&lt;br />&lt;br />We're &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/clangllvm-on-windows-update.html">working&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/#talk15">on&lt;/a> making clang &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-04/PDFs/Talks/clang-cl.pdf">usable&lt;/a> for compiling Chrome for Windows. The main motivations for this are using &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/Slides/ASan%20for%20Windows.pdf">AddressSanitizer&lt;/a>, providing a compiler with great diagnostics for developers, and getting our &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/ClangToolRefactoring">tooling infrastructure&lt;/a> working on Windows (used for example&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://crbug.com/417463">automated large-scale cross-OS refactoring&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and for building our &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/apps/launcher.h&amp;amp;sq=package:chromium&amp;amp;type=cs&amp;amp;l=18&amp;amp;rcl=1419953261">code search index&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;– try clicking a few class names; at the moment only code built on Linux is hyperlinked). We won't use clang as a production compiler on Windows unless it produces a chrome binary that's competitive with Visual Studio's on both binary size and performance. (From an open-source perspective, it &lt;i>is&lt;/i> nice being able to use an open-source compiler to compile an open-source program.)&lt;br />&lt;br />You can reach us at&amp;nbsp;clang@chromium.org&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #53, Jan 5th 2015</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/01/llvm-weekly-53-jan-5th-2015.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2015 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2015/01/llvm-weekly-53-jan-5th-2015.html</guid><description>

It's a little shorter than usual as the frenetic pace of LLVM/Clang development has slowed over the holiday period. Surprising even to me is that we managed to make it full all 52 weeks with an issue every Monday as promised. This requires a non-trivial amount of time each week (2-3+ hours), but I am intending to keep it going into 2015. I'd like to give a big thank you to everyone who's said hi at a conference, sent in corrections or tips on content, or just sent a random thank you. It's been very helpful in motivation. I don't currently intend to change anything about the structure or content of each issue for next year, but if you have any ideas then please let me know.&lt;/p>&lt;p>I can't make it to 31C3 due to the awkward timing of the event, but do let me know if there are any LLVM/Clang related talks worth sharing. There was a &lt;a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/Fahrplan/events/6050.html">talk about Code Pointer Integrity&lt;/a> which has previously been covered in LLVM Weekly and is working towards upstreaming.

If you're interested in &lt;a href="http://www.lowrisc.org">lowRISC&lt;/a> and at 31C3, Bunnie is leading a &lt;a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/wiki/Session:LowRISC_Discussion">discussion about it&lt;/a>at 2pm on Monday (today).&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/52">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>There doesn't seem to have been any LLVM or Clang related news over the past week. Everyone seems to be busy with non-LLVM related activities over the christmas break. If you're looking for a job though, Codeplay tell me they have two vancancies: one for a &lt;a href="https://www.codeplay.com/company/jobs/view.html?uid=15#.VJft5P84JA">debugger engineer&lt;/a> and another for a &lt;a href="https://www.codeplay.com/company/jobs/view.html?uid=12#.VJft7_84JA">compiler engineer&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>David Li has shared some &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80167">early info on Google's plans for LTO&lt;/a>. He describes the concept of 'peak optimization performance' and some of the objectives of the new design. This includes the ability to handle programs 10x or 100x the size of Firefox. We can expect more information in 2015, maybe as early as January.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The discussion on possible approaches to reducing the size of libLLVM has continued. Chris Bieneman has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80096">shared some more size stats&lt;/a>. These gains come from removing unused intrinsics. Chandler Carruth has followed up with a pleasingly thought-provoking argument on a different approach: &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/80130">target-specific intrinsics shouldn't exist in the LLVM front or middle-end&lt;/a>. He describes the obvious issues with this, with the most fiddly probably being instruction selection converting appropriate IR to the right target-specific functionality.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The SROA (scalar replacement of aggregates) pass has seen some refactoring to, in the future, allow for more intelligent rewriting. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL224742">r224742&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL224798">r224798&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The masked load and store intrinsics have been documented. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL224832">r224832&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>CodeGenPrepare learned to speculate calls to llvm.cttz/ctlz (count trailing/leading zeroes) if &lt;code>isCheapToSpeculateCtlz/isCheapToSpeculatCttz&lt;/code> in TargetLowering return true. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL224899">r224899&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>The Clang internals manual has been extended with stub sections on Parse, Sema, and CodeGen. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL224894">r224894&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>The libcxx LIT test-suite has seen a number of new configuration options. Even better, these are &lt;a href="http://libcxx.llvm.org/lit_usage.html">now documented&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL224728">r224728&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #51, Dec 22nd 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/12/llvm-weekly-51-dec-22nd-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2014 02:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/12/llvm-weekly-51-dec-22nd-2014.html</guid><description>

This can be used for inserting arbitrary code at a function entrypoint.

They have implemented a reducer for Souper optimizations that tries to reduce the optimization to something more minimal. There current results given ~4000 distinct optimisations of which ~1500 LLVM doesn't know how to do. Of course many of these may in fact be covered by a single rule or pass. One of the next steps for Souper is to extend Souper to support the synthesis of instruction sequences.

This includes diagnostics remarks to get feedback on why loops which aren't vectorized are skipped, the loop pragma directive in Clang, and performance warnings when the directive can't be followed.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The LLVM Haskell Compiler (LHC) has been &lt;a href="http://lhc-compiler.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/the-new-lhc.html">newly reborn&lt;/a> along with &lt;a href="http://lhc-compiler.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/very-minimal-hello-world.html">its blog&lt;/a>.

If you feel differently, now is the time to speak up.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Yichao Yu is &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/79113">curious about the current state of MCJIT for ARM&lt;/a>. Several people responded to say they've been using it with few problems on ARM, though Renato Golin &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/79147">would like to see a few more success stories&lt;/a> before marking it as 'supported' on the appropriate status page.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Tom Stellard is planning to &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/79059">start the 3.5.1 release cycle&lt;/a> shortly. Let him know if you'd like to help with testing.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>When developing a non-upstreamed LLVM backend, &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/79145">should you do it as a loadable module or just apply to a cloned LLVM repo&lt;/a>? Rafael Auler has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/79191">tried the approach of building his backend as a loadable module&lt;/a> and feels it would have been better to fork LLVM and rebase when necessary.

It has been discussed previously on this blog in &lt;/span>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2012/12/new-loop-vectorizer.html" style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">2012&lt;/span>&lt;/a>&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: justify;"> and &lt;/span>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2013/05/llvm-33-vectorization-improvements.html" style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">2013&lt;/span>&lt;/a>&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: justify;">, as well as at &lt;/span>&lt;a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/llvmautovec/" style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">FOSDEM 2014&lt;/span>&lt;/a>&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: justify;">, and at&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2013-11/#talk10" style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Apple's WWDC 2013&lt;/span>&lt;/a>&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: justify;">. The LLVM loop vectorizer combines multiple iterations of a loop to improve performance. Modern processors can exploit the independence of the interleaved instructions using advanced hardware features, such as multiple execution units and out-of-order execution, to improve performance.&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;div style="min-height: 13px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;">Unfortunately, when loop vectorization is not possible or profitable the loop is silently skipped. This is a problem for many applications that rely on the performance vectorization provides. Recent updates to LLVM provide command line arguments to help diagnose vectorization issues and new a pragma syntax for tuning loop vectorization, interleaving, and unrolling.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;h2>&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large; letter-spacing: 0px;">&lt;b>New Feature: Diagnostics Remarks&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/h2>&lt;div style="min-height: 13px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: underline;">&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/Vectorizers.html#diagnostics">Diagnostic remarks&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"> provide the user with an insight into the behavior of the behavior of LLVM’s optimization passes including unrolling, interleaving, and vectorization. They are enabled using the &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#options-to-emit-optimization-reports">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Rpass command line arguments&lt;/span>&lt;/a>. Interleaving and vectorization diagnostic remarks are produced by specifying the ‘loop-vectorize’ pass. For example, specifying ‘-Rpass=loop-vectorize’ tells us the following loop was vectorized by 4 and interleaved by 2.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="min-height: 13px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">void test1(int *List, int Length) {&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; int i = 0;&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; while(i &amp;lt; Length) {&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; List[i] = i*2;&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; i++;&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; }&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">}&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="min-height: 13px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">clang -O3 &lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #ae1916; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">-Rpass=loop-vectorize &lt;/span>&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">-S test1.c -o /dev/null&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="min-height: 13px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">test1.c:4:5: &lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #5330e1; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">remark:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;span style="color: #5330e1; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">vectorized loop (vectorization factor: 4, unrolling interleave factor: 2)&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">while(i &amp;lt; Length) {&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="color: #34bd26;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #01a900; letter-spacing: 0px;">^&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="min-height: 13px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">Many loops cannot be vectorized including loops with complicated control flow, unvectorizable types, and unvectorizable calls.

For example, when compiling for size (-Os) it's a good idea to vectorize the hot loops of the application to improve performance. Vectorization, interleaving, and unrolling can be explicitly specified using the &lt;/span>&lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#extensions-for-loop-hint-optimizations" style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">#pragma clang loop&lt;/span>&lt;/a>&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>directive&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&amp;nbsp;prior to any for, while, do-while, or c++11 range-based for loop. For example, the vectorization width and interleaving count is explicitly specified for the following loop using the loop pragma directive.&lt;/span>&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="min-height: 13px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">void test3(float *Vx, float *Vy, float *Ux, float *Uy, float *P, int Length) {&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="color: #ae1916;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">#pragma clang loop vectorize_width(4) interleave_count(4)&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="color: #ae1916;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">#pragma clang loop unroll(disable)&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; Length; i++) {&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; float A = Vx[i] * Ux[i];&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; float B = A + Vy[i] * Uy[i];&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; P[i] = B;&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; }&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">}&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="min-height: 13px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">clang -O3 &lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #ae1916; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">-Rpass=loop-vectorize &lt;/span>&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">-S test3.c -o /dev/null&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="min-height: 13px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">test3.c:5:5: &lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #5330e1; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">remark:&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;span style="color: #5330e1; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">vectorized loop (vectorization factor: 4, unrolling interleave factor: 4)&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; Length; i++) {&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="color: #34bd26;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #01a900; letter-spacing: 0px;">^&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;h3>&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large; letter-spacing: 0px;">&lt;b>Integer Constant Expressions&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;">The options vectorize_width, interleave_count, and unroll_count take an integer constant expression.

For example, vectorization fails due to the use of complex control flow. If vectorization is explicitly specified a warning message is produced to alert the programmer that the directive cannot be followed. For example, the following function which returns the last positive value in the loop, cannot be vectorized because the ‘last_positive_value’ variable is used outside the loop.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="min-height: 13px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">int test5(int *List, int Length) {&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; int last_positive_index = 0;&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; #pragma clang loop vectorize(enable)&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; for (int i = 1; i &amp;lt; Length; i++) {&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; if (List[i] &amp;gt; 0) {&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; last_positive_index = i;&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; continue;&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; List[i] = 0;&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; }&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; return last_positive_index;&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">}&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="min-height: 13px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">clang -O3 -g -S test5.c -o /dev/null&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="min-height: 13px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">test5.c:5:9: &lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #d53bd3; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">warning:&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;span style="color: #d53bd3; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">loop not vectorized: failed explicitly specified loop vectorization&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">for (int i = 1; i &amp;lt; Length; i++) {&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="color: #34bd26;">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ^&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="min-height: 13px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;">The debug option ‘-g’ allows the source line to be provided with the warning.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;h3>&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large; letter-spacing: 0.0px;">&lt;b>Conclusion&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;div style="min-height: 13px; text-align: justify;">&lt;span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;">Diagnostic remarks and the loop pragma directive are two new features that are useful for feedback-directed-performance tuning.

Python bindings have been updated to support Python 3, and this release also adds support for Sparc, SystemZ and XCore. It also has performance improvements.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Herb Sutter has penned a &lt;a href="https://isocpp.org/blog/2014/11/trip-report-fall">trip report&lt;/a> of the recent ISO C++ meeting.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Emscripten has &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/emscripten-discuss/y1_efkXYIQM">updated to use LLVM 3.4 from the PNaCl team&lt;/a>. There's more work to be done to rebase on top of 3.5.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Woboq has written a blog post &lt;a href="http://woboq.com/blog/cpp14-in-qt.html">detailing C++14 features of interest to Qt programmers&lt;/a>, though I suspect the article has a wider potential audience than that. Recent Clang of course has &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#cxx14">good support&lt;/a> for the new C++14 features.&lt;/p>&lt;p>There is going to be an LLVM Devroom at FOSDEM 2015, and the &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.lldb.devel/5757">submission deadline for presentations/talks/tutorials is on Dec 1st&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Apple's LLVM Source Tools and Program Analysis teams are &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/39769">looking for interns for Summer 2015&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>If you're wondering how the process of adding OpenMP support to Clang is going, the &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/39749">answer&lt;/a> is that it's still ongoing and there's hope it will be done by the 3.6 release, depending on the speed of code reviews.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Siva Chandra kicked off a discussion on the mailing list about &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.lldb.devel/5765">how to better manage breakages caused by LLVM or Clang API changes&lt;/a>. Siva suggests LLDB should be developed against a known-good version of LLVM/Clang that gets periodically bumped. Vince Harron says that he is &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.lldb.devel/5780">looking to add a continuous build on curated versions of Clang/LLVM&lt;/a> in addition to a continuous build on top of tree for everything. This should help improve the signal to noise ratio and make it easier for LLDB developers to tell when a breaking change is due to their addition or a change elsewhere. Reid Kleckner &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.lldb.devel/5783">suggests lldb should be treated part of the same project as Clang/LLDB&lt;/a> and more pressure should be put on developers to fix breakages, presumably in the same way that API changes in LLVM almost always come with an associated patch to fix Clang.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Peter Collingbourne has proposed &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78981">adding the llgo frontend to the LLVM project&lt;/a>. Chris Lattner is &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78982">in favour of this&lt;/a>, but would like to see the GPLv3+runtime exception dependencies rewritten before being checked in. Some people in the thread expressed concern that the existing base of LLVM/Clang reviewers know C++ and may not be able to review patches in Go, though it looks like a non-zero of existing LLVM reviewers are appropriately multilingual.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Brett Simmers is working on HHVM and &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78971">is interested if there are ways to control where a BasicBlock ends up in memory&lt;/a>, with the motivation to make best of the instruction cache by keeping frequently executed pieces of code closer together. There's general agreement this would be a great feature to have, but it doesn't sound like this is easily supported in LLVM right now.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A small doc fix has the honour of being &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL222222">commit 222222&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A nice little optimisation has been committed which replaces a switch table with a mul and add if there is a linear mapping between index and output. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL222121">r222121&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The SeparateConstOffsetFromGEP, EarlyCSE, and LICM passes have been enabled on AArch64. This has &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/D5864">measurable gains for some SPEC benchmarks&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL222331">r222331&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The description of the noalias attribute has been clarified. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL222497">r222497&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>MDNode is being split into two classes, GenericMDNode and MDNodeFwdDecl. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL222205">r222205&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LLVM CMake-based build system learned to support &lt;code>LLVM_USE_SANITIZER=Thread&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL222258">r222258&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The R600 backend gained the SIFoldOperands pass which attempts to fold source operands of mov and copy instructions into their uses. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL222581">r222581&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang now distinguishes between &lt;code>-fpic&lt;/code> and &lt;code>-fPIC&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL222227">r222227&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;code>-Wuninitialized&lt;/code> warning will now trigger when accessing an uninitialized base class in a constructor. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL222503">r222503&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLDB can now perform basic debugging operations on Windows. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL222474">r222474&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLDB's line editing support was been completely rewritten. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL222163">r222163&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>MemorySanitizer gained support for MIPS64. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL222388">r222388&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A sample tool was added to lldb to extract and dump unwind information from Darwin's compact unwind section. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL222127">r222127&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #46, Nov 17th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/11/llvm-weekly-46-nov-17th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2014 05:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/11/llvm-weekly-46-nov-17th-2014.html</guid><description>

Interestingly, Dylan doesn't link with the LLVM libraries and instead generates bitcode files directly.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The Numba project has released &lt;a href="https://github.com/numba/llvmlite">llvmlite&lt;/a>, lightweight python bindings to LLVM for writing JIT compilers.

Right now, if lifetime intrinsics are enabled for smaller objects a self-hosted build is broken. The question is whether this is due to a misunderstanding of the lifetime spec or just a hidden bug. Reid Kleckner &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78568">suggests different intrinsics for the simple case of stack allocated data&lt;/a>. He also clarifies what he means by &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78619">stack colouring&lt;/a>. This is followed by some in-depth back-and-forth discussion on the validity of transformations involving lifetime.start/lifetime.end and whether new intrinsics are required.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>James Molloy has been experimenting with the scheduling model on the Cortex-A57 and &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78492">found some oddities&lt;/a>. I noted the MicroOpBufferSize is currently set to 128, and reducing it right down to 2 seems to have no effect. Andrew Trick responded with some suggetions on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78603">implementing a custom scheduling strategy&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Volodymyr Kuznetsov and his collaborators are &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78512">asking for feedback on their patchset to implement their recently published work on control flow hijacking protection&lt;/a>. The OSDI paper is &lt;a href="http://dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/cpi.pdf">available here&lt;/a>. The current patchset covers the stack protection aspect of the paper, providing stronger protection than stack cookies at a lower overhead.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Frédéric Riss is interested in &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78706">reimplementing Darwin's dsymutil as an lld helper&lt;/a>. dsymutil is a standalone DWARF linker which is used to load merge and optimize dwarf debug info and write it out to a .dSYM file.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The PBQP register allocator has had its spill costs and coalescing benefits tweaked.

I couldn't make it, but it seems like there was a great selection of talks. Sadly the keynote about Swift's high-level IR &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvm-devmeeting/2014-October/000176.html">was cancelled&lt;/a>. No word yet on when we can expect slides and videos online. However, slides by Philip Reames and Sanjoy Das from their talk on on implementing fully relocating garbage collection in LLVM &lt;a href="http://www.playingwithpointers.com/llvm-dev-2014-slides.pdf">are online&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://whitequark.org/">Peter Zotov&lt;/a> has been doing lots of work on the LLVM OCaml bindings recently, and is looking for additional help. Recently, he's closed almost all open bugs for the bindings, migrated them to ocamlfind, fixed &lt;code>Lllvm_executionengine&lt;/code>, and ensured pretty much the whole LLM-C API is exposed. Tasks on the todo list include writing tests in OUnit2 format, migrating the Kaleidoscope tutorial off camlp4, and splitting up and adding OCaml bindings to &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/D2176">this patch&lt;/a>. More ambitiously, it would be interesting to writing LLVM passes in OCaml and to represent LLVM IR as pure AST. If any of this interests you, do get in touch with Peter. He's able to review any patches, but could do with help on working through this list of new features.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The LLVM Bay Area monthly social is &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/39524">going to be held on 6th November&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Reid Kleckner has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78419">proposed dropping support for running LLVM on Windows XP&lt;/a>. This would allow the use of system APIs only available in Vista and above. Thus far all responses have been positive, with one even suggesting raising the minimum to Windows 7.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Tom Stellard suggests &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78453">deprecating the autoconf build system&lt;/a>. Right now there is both an autotools based system and a CMake system, though CMake seems most used by developers for LLVM at least. Bob Wilson &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78459">points out&lt;/a> that the effort required to keep the existing makefiles working is much less than what might be needed to update the CMake build to support all uses cases. Though other replies make it seems that the CMake build supports pretty much all configurations people use now. If there are people who actually enjoy fiddling with build systems (far-fetched, I know), it seems like a little effort could go a long way and allow the makefile system to be jettisoned.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Betul Buyukkurt has posted an &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78415">RFC on indirect call target profiling&lt;/a>. The goal is to use the collected data for optimisation. Kostya Serebryany &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/39563">described how it can be used to provide feedback to fuzzers&lt;/a> and detailed properties that would be useful for this usecase.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Chris Matthews &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/78319">announces&lt;/a> that a new Jenkins-based OSX build cluster is up and running. This includes multiple build profiles and an O3 LTO performance tracker. The Jenkins config should be committed to zorg soon.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for writing sampling profiles has been committed. In the future, support to read (and maybe write) profiles in GCC's gcov format will be added, and llvm-profdata will get support to manipulate sampling profiles. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL220915">r220915&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A comment has been added to X86AsmInstrumentation to describe how asm instrumentation works. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL220670">r220670&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The Microsoft vectorcall calling convention has been implemented for x86 and x86-64. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL220745">r220745&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The C (and OCaml) APIs gained functions to query and modify branches, and to obtain the values for floating point constants. There have been a whole bunch of additional commits related to the OCaml bindings, too many to pick out anything representative. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL220814">r220814&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL220815">r220815&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL220817">r220817&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL220818">r220818&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The loop and SLP (superword level parallelism) vectorizers are now enabled in the Gold plugin. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL220886">r220886&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL220887">r220887&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>A refactoring of libTooling to reduce required dependencies means that clang-format's binary is now roughly half the size. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL220867">r220867&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>lldb has started to adopt the StringPrinter API. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL220894">r220894&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Initial support for PowerPC/PowerPC64 on FreeBSD has been added to LLDB. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL220944">r220944&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #43, Oct 27th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/10/llvm-weekly-43-oct-27th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2014 04:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/10/llvm-weekly-43-oct-27th-2014.html</guid><description>

A large number of &lt;a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2014-10/msg00040.html">potential starting points for new contributors&lt;/a> has been posted to the GCC mailing list.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Hayden Livingston is curious about &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/77745">examples of LLVM usage for whole program optimisations&lt;/a>, mentioning LLVM JIT functionality and GC as areas of interest. Philip Reames &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/77750">responded&lt;/a> with a good description of the current state and also noted his patchset for &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/D5683">GC statepoint intrinsics&lt;/a> is up for review and should hopefully be merged in the coming weeks. Filip Pizlo who worked on Apple's FTL JS JIT &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/77753">responded to advocate use of a Bartlett-style mostly-copying collector&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Peter Collingbourne has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/77678">proposed official Go bindings be added to the LLVM project&lt;/a>. Thus far all replies seem positive.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Saleem Abdulrasool points out that &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/77537">lld doesn't conform to the LLVM/Clang coding style&lt;/a>. As you can imagine, few topics attract more feedback from developers than whitespace and variable naming conventions so the thread is rather long. There's general agreement that it would be better if lld used the LLVM style, though unease about moving over in a single large patch on the basis that this would dirty commit history and make git/svn blame less useful. A patch was submitted to git some years ago to &lt;a href="http://git.661346.n2.nabble.com/PATCH-blame-can-specify-shas-of-commits-to-ignore-on-command-line-td5001395.html">implement the ability to ignore certain shas in git blame&lt;/a> but it seems the feature was never added.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Switches with only two cases and a default are now optimised to a couple of selects. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219223">r219223&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>llvm-symbolizer will now be used to symbolize LLVM/Clang crash dumps. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219534">r219534&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The calculation of loop trip counts for loops with multiple exits has been de-pessimized. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219517">r219517&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>MIPS fast-isel learnt integer and floating point compare and conditional branches. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219518">r219518&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219530">r219530&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219556">r219556&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>R600 gained a load/store machine optimizer pass. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219533">r219533&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The integrated assembler has been turned on by default for ppc64 and ppc64le. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219129">r219129&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>clang-format's interpretation of special comments to disable formatting within a delimited range has been documented. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219204">r219204&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The integrated assembler has been turned on by default for SystemZ. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219426">r219426&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>lld gained support for 'fat' mach-o archives. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219268">r219268&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The lldbtk example has seen some further development. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219219">r219219&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>lldb-gdbserver can now be used for local-process Linux debugging. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219457">r219457&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The disassembly format for lldb can now be customized. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219544">r219544&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #40, Oct 6th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/10/llvm-weekly-40-oct-6th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2014 05:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/10/llvm-weekly-40-oct-6th-2014.html</guid><description>

This release features support for Sparc, SystemZ and XCore as well as the previously supported architectures. Among other changes, the Python bindings are now compatible with Python 3.&lt;/p>&lt;p>An interesting paper from last year came up on the mailing list. From EPFL, it proposes &lt;a href="http://dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/overify.pdf">adding -OVERIFY to optimise programs for fast verification&lt;/a>. The performance of symbolic execution tools is improved by reducing the number of paths to explore and the complexity of branch conditions. They managed a maximum 95x reduction in total compilation and analysis time.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The next Cambridge (UK) social &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/77453">will take place on Wed 8th Oct at 7.30 pm&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Reid Kleckner has posted an RFC on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/39152">approaches to representing structured exception handling (SEH) in LLVM IR&lt;/a>. This is the exception handling model used on Windows.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Chandler Carruth has written to the list to &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/77439">announce his new x86 vector shuffle lowering path is now enabled by default&lt;/a>. This code path has seen extensive fuzz testing. The performance improvement is largest on AMD chips with older SSE versions. If anyone is able to find a performance regression, you are encouraged to report it.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Richard Pennington who maintains the Clang/LLVM ELLCC cross-development toolchain is &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/77431">considering dropping support for Microblaze&lt;/a>. The Microblaze backend was dropped from LLVM last year, but Richard has been maintaining it out of tree. However there seems to be very little actual interest. If somebody wants to pick it up, now is the time to jump in.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The expansion of atomic loads/stores for PowerPC has been improved. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218922">r218922&lt;/a>. The documentation on atomics has also been updated. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218937">r218937&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>For the past few weeks, Chandler Carruth has been working on a new vector shuffle lowering implementation. There have been too many commits to summarise, but the time has come and the new codepath is now enabled by default. It claims 5-40% improvements in the right conditions (when the loop vectorizer fires in the hot path for SSE2/SSE3). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219046">r219046&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The Cortex-A57 scheduling model has been refined. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218627">r218627&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>SimplifyCFG now has a configurable threshold for folding branches with common destination. Changing this threshold can be worthwhile for GPU programs where branches are expensive. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218711">r218711&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Basic support for the newly-announced Cortex-M7 has been added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218747">r218747&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>As discussed on the mailing list last week, the sqrt intrinsic will now return undef when given a negative input. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218803">r218803&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>llvm-readobj learnt &lt;code>-coff-imports&lt;/code> which will print out the COFF import table. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218891">r218891&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218915">r218915&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for the &lt;code>align_value&lt;/code> attribute has been added, matching the behaviour of the attribute in the Intel compiler. The commit message explains why this attribute is useful in addition to &lt;code>aligned&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218910">r218910&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A rather useful diagnostic has been added. &lt;code>-Winconsistent-missing-override&lt;/code> will warn if override is missing on an overridden method if that class has at least one override specified on its methods. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218925">r218925&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for MS ABI continues. &lt;code>thread_local&lt;/code> is now supported for global variables. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219074">r219074&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Matcher and DynTypedMatcher saw some nice performance tweaking, resulting in a 14% improvement on a clang-tidy benchmark and compilation of Dynamic/Registry.cpp sped up by 17%. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218679">r218616&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>lifetime.start and lifetime.end markers are now emitted for unnamed temporary objects. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218865">r218865&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;code>__sync_fetch_and_nand&lt;/code> intrinsic was re-added. See the commit message for a history of its removal. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218905">r218905&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang gained its own implementation of C11 &lt;code>stdatomic.h&lt;/code>. The system header will be used in preference if present. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218957">r218957&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang now understands &lt;code>-mthread-model&lt;/code> to specify the thread model to use, e.g. posix, single (for bare-metal and single-threaded targets). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL219027">r219027&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>libcxxabi should now work with the ARM Cortex-M0. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218869">r218869&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>lldb gained initial support for scripting stepping. This is the ability to add new stepping modes implemented by python classes. The example in the follow-on commit has a large comment at the head of the file to explain its operation. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218642">r218642&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL218650">r218650&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #39, Sep 29th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/09/llvm-weekly-39-sep-29th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2014 05:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/09/llvm-weekly-39-sep-29th-2014.html</guid><description>

Yes, my dedication to weekly LLVM updates is so great that I'm writing it on holiday. Enjoy! I'll also note that I'm at PyCon UK next week where I'll be &lt;a href="http://pyconuk.net/Schedule">presenting&lt;/a> on the results of a project we had some interns working on over the summer creating a programming game for the Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/37">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Not only does Pyston have a shiny new blog, they've also &lt;a href="http://blog.pyston.org/2014/09/11/9/">released version 0.2&lt;/a>. Pyston is an implementation of Python using LLVM, led by Dropbox. This release supports a range of language features that weren't supported in 0.1, including support for the native C API. The plan is to focus on performance during the development cycle for 0.3.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Sylvestre Ledru has posted a &lt;a href="http://sylvestre.ledru.info/blog/2014/09/11/rebuild-of-debian-using-clang-3-5">report of progress in building Debian with Clang&lt;/a> following the completion of this year's Google Summer of Code projects. Now with Clang 3.5.0 1261 packages fail to build with Clang. Sylvestre describes how they're attacking the problem from both sides, by submitting patches to upstream projects as well as to Clang where appropriate (e.g. to ignore some unsupported optimisation flags rather than erroring out).&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Philip Reames has started a discussion on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76702">adding optimisation hints for 'constant' loads&lt;/a>. A common case is where a field is initialised exactly once and then is never modified. If this invariant could be expressed, it could improve alias analysis as the AA pass would never consider that field to MayAlias with something else (Philip reports that the obvious approach of using type-based alias analysis isn't quite enough).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Hal Finkel has posted an &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76647">RFC on attaching attributes to values&lt;/a>. Currently, attributes such as noalias and nonnull can be attached to function parameters, but in cases such as C++11 lambdas these can be packed up into a structure and the attributes are lost. Some followup discussion focused on whether these could be represented as metadata. The problem there of course is that metadata is intended to be droppable (i.e. is semantically unimportant). I very much like the &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76700">suggestion&lt;/a> from Philip Reames that the test suite should run with a pass that forcibly drops metadata to verify it truly is safe to drop.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Robin Morisset has posted a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76800">proposal on implementing a fence elimination algorithm&lt;/a>. The proposed algorithm is based on partial redundancy elimination. He's looking for feedback on the suggested implementation approach.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>There's been a little bit of discussion on the topic of &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76679">rekindling work on VMKit&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The start of the llvm.assume infrastructure has been committed, as well as an AlignmentFromAssumptions pass. See &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74941">the original RFC&lt;/a> for a refresher on the llvm.assume intrinsic. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL217342">r217342&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL217344">r217344&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM's sample profile reader has been refactored into lib/ProfileData. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL217437">r217437&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The AMD 16H Jaguar microarchitecture now has a scheduling model. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL217457">r217457&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The 'bigobj' COFF variant can now be read. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL217496">r217496&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;code>__builtin_assume&lt;/code> and &lt;code>__builtin_assume_aligned&lt;/code> intrinsics have been added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL217349">r217349&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The thread safety TIL (Typed Intermediate Language) has seen a major update. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL217556">r217556&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>LLD gained support for AArch64 Mach-O. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL217469">r217469&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #36, Sep 8th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/09/llvm-weekly-36-sep-8th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2014 07:51:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/09/llvm-weekly-36-sep-8th-2014.html</guid><description>

The fourth and hopefully final release candidate is &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76370">available for testing&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Quarks Lab have published a &lt;a href="http://blog.quarkslab.com/scaf-source-code-analysis-framework-based-on-clang-pre-alpha-preview.html">preview of SCAF&lt;/a>, a Source Code Analysis Framework built on Clang. It promises a release soon.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://vmkit.llvm.org/">VMKit project website&lt;/a> has this week been &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216831">updated&lt;/a> to mark the project as retired. VMKit was a project to implement virtual machines such as a JVM on top of LLVM. People interested in restarting the project are encouraged to get in touch with Gaël Thomas.&lt;/p>&lt;p>AMD and Microsoft have &lt;a href="http://sdtimes.com/amd-announces-heterogeneous-c-amp-language-developers/">released a C++ AMP compiler targeting version 1.2 of the specification&lt;/a>. The C++ AMP (Accelerated Massive Parallelism) compiler is of course based on LLVM and Clang, and can be &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/cppamp-driver-ng/wiki/Home">found here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Manuel Klimek has provided a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/38657">quick run-down of the state of his work on Clang C++ refactoring tools&lt;/a>. He reports there are a number of standalone, single-use refacotring tools but more work needs to be done on generalising and integrating them. The plan is to push more of these tools to tools-extra (where clang-rename lives), make them integratable as a library, integrate them into libclang and then integrate them into projects like &lt;a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd">ycmd&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Robin Morisset has been working on optimisations for lowering of atomics and has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76400">asked for input on a fence elimination algorithm&lt;/a> he's been thinking about. He has outlined two possible implementation routes he would like feedback on.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A discussion about &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76278">improving llvm-objdump&lt;/a>, kicked offed by Steve King, makes an interesting read. I'm looking forward to a future with a more featureful llvm-objdump that prints symbols of branch targets by default.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>David Blaikie has started a discussion about &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76341">supporting -gmlt in LLVM/Clang&lt;/a>. Vital to having any chance of understanding this thread is to know that gmlt refers to debug info containing 'minimal line tables', a feature that &lt;a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2011-04/msg02075.html">was added to GCC a while back&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>I linked last week to the mailing list thread on removing static initializers for command line options and regrettably was unable to summarise the extensive discussion. The bad news is discussion has continued at a rapid pace, but thankfully Chandler Carruth has rather helpfully &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76279">sumarised the main outcomes of the discussion&lt;/a>. It's also worth reading &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76382">this thread&lt;/a> for an idea of what the new infrastructure might look like.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The AArch64 backend learned about v4f16 and v8f16 operations, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216555">r216555&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LLVM CMake build system now includes support for building with UndefinedBehaviourSanitizer. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216701">r216701&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;code>-fdevirtualize&lt;/code> and &lt;code>-fdevirtualize-speculatively&lt;/code> flags are now recognised (and ignored) for compatibility with GCC. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216477">r216477&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Some Google Summer of Code work has started to land. In particular, the Clang static analyzer gained initial infrastructure to support for synthesizing function implementations from external model files. See the commit message for full details on the intent of this feature. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216550">r216550&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support was added for capturing variable length arrays in C++11 lambda expressions. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216649">r216649&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLDB gained documentation on its internal register numbering scheme. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216372">r216372&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLDB is making progress towards AArch64 support. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216737">r216736&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #34, Aug 25th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/08/llvm-weekly-34-aug-25th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2014 12:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/08/llvm-weekly-34-aug-25th-2014.html</guid><description>

As ever, test it on your codebases and report any regressions.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Adrian Sampson has written a &lt;a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~asampson/blog/quala.html">blog post about Quala&lt;/a>, a tool for implementing pluggable type systems for C/C++ using Clang. The example type systems are a system allowing nullable and non-nullable pointers as well as an information flow tracking system. In the future, Adrian wants to connect type annotations to LLVM IR.&lt;/p>&lt;p>C++14 is &lt;a href="http://isocpp.org/blog/2014/08/we-have-cpp14">now done&lt;/a>. A quick look at the &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#cxx14">Clang C++14 implementation status&lt;/a>confirms that Clang support is in pretty good shape.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Santiago Fernandez has been an intern on the .NET team at Microsoft this summer. In this MSDN Channel9 posting, Beth Massi &lt;a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/funkyonex/Fun-with-the-Interns-Santiago-Fernandez-on-LLVM-Based-Optimizer-for-MSIL">interviews him about his work on using LLVM in the .NET native code generator&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The next Cambridge (UK) LLVM social &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75952">will be held on Weds 27th August, 7.30pm&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>There is a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.lldb.devel/4887">proposal&lt;/a> to move the minimum supported Visual Studio version for compiling LLVM/Clang up to 2013 from 2012. LLVM/Clang 3.6 would be the first stable release with this requirement assuming there are no objections. With the introduction of C++11 features into the LLVM/Clang codebases, MSVC2012 support is troublesome due to a number of unsupported constructs. If this change would effect you negatively, now is the time to pipe up.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Richard Carback &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75943">reports&lt;/a> that two of his interns at Draper Laboratories have been working on resurrecting the LLVM C Backend, with &lt;a href="https://github.com/draperlaboratory/llvm-cbe">source on Github&lt;/a>. If this is to make it back into the mainstream repository, somebody will have to volunteer to maintain it which &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75974">Richard has kindly done&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Diego Novillo has posted an &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/76135">update on his plans for supporting profile data from Perf in LLVM&lt;/a>. He is now planning on keeping conversion to Perf's format out-of-tree. The current LLVM representation can be used as an exchange format, but Diego will be submitting a more compact representation for internal use.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Chris Bieneman has posted an RFC on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75954">removing static initializers for command line options&lt;/a>. This would make it easier for LLVM clients like WebKit and Mesa. There is a lot of discussion about this proposal that I'm afraid I don't have time to summarise.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>X86 Haswell gained a detailed scheduling model. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL215094">r215094&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL215095">r215905&lt;/a>, and more.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM's code coverage mapping format gained extensive documentation. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL215990">r215990&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>FastISel for AArch64 saw yet more changes, this time optimisations for ADDS/SUBS emission and support for variable shifts. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216033">r216033&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216242">r216242&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The MIPS assembler gained support for &lt;code>.set arch=x&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL215978">r215978&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The PeepholeOptimizer has been improved to take advantage of the recently added isRegSequence, isExtractSubreg, and isInsertSubreg properties. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216088">r216088&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216136">r216136&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216144">r216144&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A thread-model option has been added along with the 'single' option for lowering atomics on baremetal and single-threaded systems. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216182">r216182&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The gold plugin has been rewritten in order to fix &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19901">bug 19901&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216215">r216215&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>C++1y is now called C++14. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL215982">r215982&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>CGcall (code generation for function call) has been refactored. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216251">r216251&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The libcxx build and test system gained support for &lt;code>LLCM_USE_SANITIZER&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL215872">r215872&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>libcxxabi/libunwind now supports baremetal ARM. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL216202">r216202&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #33, Aug 18th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/08/llvm-weekly-33-aug-18th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2014 05:07:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/08/llvm-weekly-33-aug-18th-2014.html</guid><description>

To coincide with that, they've published a &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/lldb-dev/2014-August/004768.html">series of blog posts&lt;/a> covering the MI driver's implementation, how to set it up from within Eclipse, and how to add support for new MI commands.&lt;/p>&lt;p>McSema, a framework for transforming x86 programs to LLVM bitcode has &lt;a href="http://blog.trailofbits.com/2014/08/07/mcsema-is-officially-open-source/">now been open-sourced&lt;/a>. The talk about McSema from the ReCON conference is also now online.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Registration for the LLVM Developer's Meeting 2014 is &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/#registration">now open&lt;/a>. The event will take place in San Jose on October 28th-29th. You have until September 1st to &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75567">submit your talk/BoF/poster/tutorial proposal&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Robin Morisset, currently an intern at Google has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75534">written about his plan to optimize C11/C++11 atomics in LLVM&lt;/a>. This resulted in a discussion on &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2014-August/075573.html">whether some of these transformation should be done at the IR level&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Dan Liew has written a long post about &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75575">re-organising and improving zorg&lt;/a> (LLVM's testing and buildbot infrastructure).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Eric Christopher has written to the mailing list to warn us of &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75475">incoming API changes&lt;/a>. These changes include modifying getSubtarget/getSubtargetImpl to take a Function/MachineFunction, so sub-targets could be used based on attributes on the function.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Sergey Ostanevich from Intel has &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2014-August/075606.html">shared&lt;/a> a &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/attachments/20140809/cd6c7f7a/attachment-0001.pdf">proposal for the implementation of OpenMP offloading in LLVM&lt;/a>. This proposal was created by contributors from IBM, Intel, ANL, TI, and AMD. The example given would allow code to be offloaded to e.g. a Xeon Phi co-processor if present, or a GPU.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Delesley Hutchins has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/38248">shared an update on his work on thread safety analysis&lt;/a>.

He is looking for feedback on how to limit the propagation of negative capabilities.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Initial work on the MachineCombiner pass landed. This estimates critical path length of the original instruction sequence vs a transformed (combined) instruction sequence and chooses the faster code. An example given in the commit message is choosing between add+mul vs madd on AArch64, and a followup commit implements MachineCombiner for this target. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214666">r214666&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214669">r214669&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A few useful helper functions were added to the LLVM C API: &lt;code>LLVM{IsConstantString, GetAsString, GetElementAsConstant}&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214676">r214976&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A whole load of AVX512 instructions were added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214719">r214719&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>FastISel for AArch64 now support basic argument lowering. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214846">r214846&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A flag has been added to experiment with running the loop vectorizer before the SLP vectorizer. According to the commit message, eventually this should be the default. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214963">r214963&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The old JIT is almost dead, it has been removed (for those not paying close attention, 3.5 has already been branched so still contains the old JIT). However, the patch was then reverted, so it's in zombie status. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL215111">r215111&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>AArch64 gained a load balancing pass for the Cortex-A57, which tries to make maximum use of available resources by balancing use of even and odd FP registers. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL215199">r215199&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Thread safety analysis gained support for negative requirements to be specified. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214725">r214725&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Coverage mapping generation has been committed. The &lt;code>-fcoverage-mapping&lt;/code> command line option can be used to generate coverage mapping information, which can then be combined with execution counts from instrumentation-based profiling to perform code coverage analysis. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214752">r214752&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A command line option to limit the alignment that the compiler can assume for an arbitrary pointer. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214911">r214911&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLDB's FileSpec class learned to understand Windows paths. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL215123">r215123&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLDB learned a whole bunch of new commands and features for its Machine Interface. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL215223">r215223&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>OpenMP gained PowerPC64 support. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL215093">r215093&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #31, Aug 4th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/08/llvm-weekly-31-aug-4th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2014 09:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/08/llvm-weekly-31-aug-4th-2014.html</guid><description>

This both summarises the main areas he's looking for collaboration, and the feedback that people gave at the event or afterwards.&lt;/p>&lt;p>This blog post describes &lt;a href="http://fuzion24.github.io/android/obfuscation/ndk/llvm/o-llvm/2014/07/27/android-obfuscation-o-llvm-ndk/">how to use Obfuscator-LLVM to to obfuscate Android NDK binaries&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Johannes Kapfhammer, a Google Summer of Code student has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/38105">posted an RFC on adding a fuzzy parser for highlighting C++&lt;/a>. The Clang parser can't be used for this as it may be highlighting incomplete snippets where not all types or functions are included. It was pointed out in responses that this is similar to clang-format's parser, but apparently this parser is not easily reusable and very tied to the clang-format implementation.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>In response to a query about whether there is interest in a performance tracking BOF at the LLVM Dev meeting, Renato Golin has posted a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75410">summary of related issues discussed at the last meeting and progress made on them&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>John Kåre Alsaker posted a question about &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75230">adding a stack probe function attribute&lt;/a>. This would be used for languages like Rust that attempt to detect stack overflow with the use of a guard page. Philip Reames responded with &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75399">a number of thoughts on this feature&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Daniel Stewart has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75350">implemented ELF/AArch64 support for lld&lt;/a> and is looking for how to upstream it. People are happy for a single patch to be posted for review.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>In response to a question about documentation for adding builders to the LLVM buildbot service, Dan Liew has posted a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75355">summary of how he has done it&lt;/a>. He's looking for feedback on whether this is the best way to do things.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>John Kåre Alsaker has asked for feedback on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75231">enhancing BasicAliasAnalysis for Rust&lt;/a>. Rust's restrictions on aliasing are not currenly fully taken advantage of. Both &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75260">Hal Finkel&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75286">Cameron Zwarich&lt;/a> respond with thoughts on how to proceed.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Tom Stellard &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75214">proposes renaming the R600 target to AMDGPU&lt;/a>. The motivation is that the backend has the name since the R600 was the first AMD GPU targeted, but it has added support for all AMD GPUs since then. There seems to be agreement this would be a sensible renaming.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>FastISel for AArch64 saw a number of improvements, including support for shift-immediate, arithmetic with overflow intrinsics. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214345">r214345&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214348">r214348&lt;/a>, and more.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The SLPVectorizer has seen a largeish commit that implements an "improved scheduling algorithm". Sadly the commit message offers no further details. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214494">r214494&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>TargetInstrInfo gained &lt;code>isAsCheapAsMove&lt;/code> which takes a MachineInstruction and returns true if that instruction is as cheap as a move instruction. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214158">r214158&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM libraries can now be exported as importable CMake targets, making it easier for those building LLVM-based projects. This is now documented. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214077">r214077&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Release notes for PowerPC changes during 3.5 development have been committed. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214403">r214403&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Initial work towards supporting debug locations for fragmented variables (e.g. by-value struct arguments passed in registers) has been committed. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL214576">r214576&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Work on support for the MSVC ABI continues.

This is a very promising tool that aims to aid the specification and proof of peephole optimisations (such as those currently found in LLVM's InstCombine). It uses an SMT solver in order to prove optimisations correct (and if incorrect, provides a counter-example).&lt;/p>&lt;p>Source and binaries for the first LLVM/Clang 3.5 Release Candidate &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/37969">are now available&lt;/a>.

The proposed feature addition would consist of a command-line tool to semantically rename a symbol and an API that could be used by IDEs/editors to do the same.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Lang Hames &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75175">reminds LLVM users to switch to MCJIT&lt;/a>.

The motivation for this is to preserve noalias function attribute information when inlining and to model block-scope C99 restrict pointers. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL213864">r213864&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL213948">r213948&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL213949">r213949&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The llvm-vtabledump tool is born. This will dump vtables inside object files.

&lt;p>Welcome to the twenty-ninth issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter (published every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related projects.LLVM Weekly is brought to you by &lt;a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex Bradbury&lt;/a>.Subscribe to future issues at &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org&lt;/a> and pass it on to anyone else you think may be interested. Please send any tips or feedback to &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#97;&amp;#115;&amp;#98;&amp;#64;&amp;#97;&amp;#115;&amp;#98;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#100;&amp;#98;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#121;&amp;#46;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;">&amp;#97;&amp;#115;&amp;#98;&amp;#64;&amp;#97;&amp;#115;&amp;#98;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#100;&amp;#98;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#121;&amp;#46;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;&lt;/a>, or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury&lt;/a> on Twitter.&lt;/p>&lt;p>This is a special extended issue which I'm choosing to subtitle "LLVM Weekly visits the GNU Tools Cauldron". The &lt;a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/cauldron2014">event&lt;/a> took place over the weekend and had a wide range of interesting talks. You can find my notes at the end of this newsletter. Talks were recorded and the videos should be made available in the next month or two.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/29">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The eighth annual LLVM Developers meeting has been &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74893">announced&lt;/a> and will take place on October 28th and 29th in San Jose, CA. It is looking for sponsors and talk/poster submissions.&lt;/p>&lt;p>A new blog post as been published on the LLVM Blog giving &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html">more details on FTL: WebKit's LLVM-based JIT&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>A tentative &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/37785">schedule for the release of LLVM/Clang 3.5&lt;/a> has been posted.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Botond Ballo has posted a &lt;a href="http://botondballo.wordpress.com/2014/07/17/trip-report-c-standards-committee-meeting-in-rapperswil-june-2014/">summary of June's C++ Standards Committee Meeting&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Hal Finkel has posted an &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74941">RFC on adding an IR-level intrinsic to LLVM to represent invariants&lt;/a>. These are conditions that the optimizer is allowed to assume will be valid during the execution of the program. The post also comes with a complete set of patches implementing the concept. An issue raised by Philip Reames is that by representing the invariant as an IR instruction, this may affect profitability heuristics in optimisation passes. Chandler Carruth followed up with a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74946">clear description of the trade-offs&lt;/a> which it seems people mostly agree with.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Yuri Gribov has re-opened a previously discussed issue, that &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74863">LLVM and GCC set the frame pointer to point to different stack slots on ARM&lt;/a>. Renato Golin &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74908">responded&lt;/a> with an explanation of how GCC ended up doing things differently. The AddressSanitizer people would prefer things to be unified so they can use knowledge of the layout to perform unwinding without using tables (a speed optimisation). It doesn't seem likely that either LLVM or GCC will be changing though.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Diego Novillo is &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74881">soliciting feedback on integrating his autofdo tool into LLVM&lt;/a>. AutoFDO is a tool that converts data collected from Linux perf to a format that can be used by LLVM.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Philip Reames &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74887">asks whether anyone has implemented a framework for asking liveness questions for SSA values in the IR&lt;/a>. The lack of an immediate answer suggests they have not, though Andrew Trick points to &lt;a href="http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/58/53/03/PDF/RR-7503.pdf">Computing Liveness Sets for SSA-Form Programs&lt;/a> while Dibyendu Das points to &lt;a href="http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/64/73/69/PDF/ramakrishna_taco.pdf">Efficient Liveness Computation Using Merge Sets and DJ-Graphs&lt;/a> which is along the same lines.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Tim Northover has written an RFC suggesting that &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/37777">llvm.convert.to.fp16 and related intrinsics should be dropped&lt;/a>. Instead the 'half' type can be used in combination with fpext/fptrunc.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Chandler Carruth has written an RFC regarding &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/75018">legalizing operations and post-legalization DAG combining&lt;/a>. It's only just been posted so there's no feedback yet.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Andrew Kaylor has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74930">proposed&lt;/a> that Lang Hames take over from him as code owner for MCJIT, RuntimeDyld, and JIT event listener. This was agreed and &lt;code>CODE_OWNERS.txt&lt;/code> has been updated appropriately.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A dereferenceable attribute was added. This indicates that the parameter or return pointer is dereferenceable (i.e. can be loaded from speculatively without a risk of trapping). This is subtly different to the nonnull attribute which doesn't necessarily imply dereferenceability (you might for instance have a pointer to one element past the end of an array). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL213385">r213385&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new subtarget hook was added to allow targets to opt-out of register coalescing.&lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL213078">r213078&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL213188">r213188&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A MergedLoadStoreMotion pass was added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL213396">r213396&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>RegionInfo has been templatified to it works on MachineBasicBlocks. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL213456">r213456&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A monster patch from Nvidia adds a whole bunch of surface/texture intrinsics to the NVPTX backend. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL213256">r213256&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support was added for emitting warnings if vectorization is forced and fails. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL213110">r213110&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Improvements to FastISel continue with the implementation of the FastLowerCall hook for X86. This actually reproduces what was already being done in X86, but is refactored against the target independent call lowering. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL213049">r213049&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The ARM dmb, dsb and isb intrinsics have been implemented for AARch64. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL213247">r213247&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang's rewrite engine is now a core feature (i.e. it can not be disabled at configure time). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL213171">r213171&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Error recovery when the programmer mistypes &lt;code>::&lt;/code> as &lt;code>:&lt;/code> was improved. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL213120">r213120&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The AARch64 Clang CLI interface proposal for &lt;code>-march&lt;/code> has been implemented.

Apologies for any inaccuracies, please do get in touch if you spot anything I may have noted incorrectly. LLVM followers may be particularly interested in Renato Golin's talk on collaboration between the GCC and LLVM communities.&lt;/p>&lt;h4>Glibc BoF&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>&lt;li>2.20 is in "slushy" freeze mode. What else is left? fmemopen, fd locking, some &lt;code>-Wundef&lt;/code> work&lt;/li>&lt;li>Anyone planning to check in something big for 2.21?&lt;ul>&lt;li>Mentor Graphics planning to check in a NIOS II port. They won't be accepted until Linux kernel patches are in a kernel release.&lt;/li>&lt;li>A desire for AArch64 ILP32 ABI to get in. Kernel patches currently in review, compiler work is ready.&lt;/li>&lt;li>OpenRISC&lt;/li>&lt;li>NaCl (nptl)&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;/li>&lt;li>Benchmarking glibc? Does anyone have a good approach. There is a preload library approach (see notes from Ondrej's talk).&lt;/li>&lt;li>Glibc has been built with AddressSanitizer, help needed to get it integrated into the build system. There was a comment this would be nice to get in to distributions.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Red Hat are working on supporting alternate libm implementations, including a low-precision and high-precision implementation. Intel are looking to add math functions that work on small vectors.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h4>Abigail: toward ABI taming&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>&lt;li>Want to determine if changes to your shared library break apps for users, and users want to know whether an updated library remains compatible with their code. The bidiff tool will tell you the differences in terms of ABI given two object files as its input.&lt;/li>&lt;li>libabi consists of modules such as a DWARF reader, the comparison engine. Tools such as bidiff are built on this API&lt;/li>&lt;li>What's next for libabigail?&lt;ul>&lt;li>bicompat will help application authors determine whether their application A is still compatibile with an updated version of a given library L by examining the undefined symbols of A that are resolved by L.&lt;/li>&lt;li>More amenable to automation (such as integration into build systems)&lt;/li>&lt;li>Support for un-instantiated templates. This would require declarations of uninstantiated templates to be represented in DWARF.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;/li>&lt;li>A first official release (though source is available at &lt;a href="https://sourceware.org/libabigail/">https://sourceware.org/libabigail/&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h4>Writing VMs in Java and debugging them with GDB&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>&lt;li>Oracle Labs have been working on various dynamic language implementations in Java (e.g. Ruby, Python, R, JS, ...).&lt;/li>&lt;li>FastR is a reimplementation of R in Java featuring an interpreter (Truffle) and dynamic compiler (Graal).&lt;/li>&lt;li>Truffle and Graal starts with an AST interpreter. The first time a node is evaluated it is specialised to the type that was seen at runtime. Later the tree is compiled using partial evaluation.&lt;/li>&lt;li>It may be deployed on standard HotSpot (no compilation), GraalVM, or the SubstrateVM (SVM) which uses Graal to ahead-of-time compile the language implementation. Debugging the SVM is difficult as Java debugging tools are not available. The solution is to generate DWARF information in the SVM's output.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Truffle and Graal are open source, the SubstrateVM is not (yet?).&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h4>GCC and LLVM collaboration&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>&lt;li>Good news: license issues, personal grudges and performance are off-topic.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Users should be protected from whatever disagreements take place. In the future we should have more pro-active discussions on various issues as opposed to reactive discussions regarding e.g. compiler flags that have been noticed to be arbitrarily different after the fact.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Renato lists common projects that we may collaborate on: binutils, glibc, sanitizers. Sanitizers are a collaboration success story.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Can we agree on a (new?) common user interface?&lt;/li>&lt;li>There's a surprising amount of confusion about &lt;code>-march&lt;/code>, &lt;code>-mtune&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>-mcpu&lt;/code> considering we're in a room of compiler developers. It sounds like there's not much support for re-engineering the set of compiler flags as the potential gain is not seen as being great enough.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Can we agree to standardise on attributes, C/C++ extensions, builtins, ASM, the linker API?&lt;/li>&lt;li>GCC docs have just been rewritten, so some criticisms about how difficult it is to dig in are no longer valid.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h4>Machine Guided Energy Efficient Compilation&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>&lt;li>Initial investigations in 2012 found that compiler flags can have a meaningful effect on energy consumption. This raises the question of how to determine which flags to use.&lt;/li>&lt;li>MAGEEC will target both GCC and LLVM initially. It is implemented as a compiler plugin which performs feature extraction and allows the output of the machine learning algorithm to change the sequence of passes which are run. Fractional Factorial Design is used to reduce the optimisation space to explore.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Turning passes on/off arbitrarily can often result in internal compiler errors. Should the machine learning algorithm learn this, or should GCC better document pass requirements?&lt;/li>&lt;li>It would be useful to MAGEEC if the (currently internal) plugin API could be stabilized. They also currently have to use a hacked up Clang as it doesn't provide plugin hooks.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The project has produced a low cost energy measurement board as well as their own benchmark suite (Bristol/Embecosm Embedded Benchmark Suite, or BEEBS). BEEBS 2.0 is schedule for release by 31st August 2014 with a much wider range of benchmarks (currently 93). Jeremy showed a rather pleasing live demo where you can run a benchmark on a microcontroller development board and immediately find the number of mJ consumed in running it.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The current state of the project has it not achieving better results than GCC O2, but this is expected to change over the coming months.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h4>Just-in-time compilation using GCC&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/JIT">libgccjit.so&lt;/a> is an experimental branch of GCC which allows you to build GCC as a shared library and embed it in other programs in order to allow in-process code generation at runtime.&lt;/li>&lt;li>A dedicated API for JIT will allow better stability guarantees. It provides a high-level API designed for ease of use.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The API doesn't offer solutions for type inference, escape analysis, unboxing, inline caching, etc.&lt;/li>&lt;li>It has a C++ API wich includes some cunning operator overloading to massively reduce verbosity, and a Python API.&lt;/li>&lt;li>David Malcolm has written &lt;a href="https://github.com/davidmalcolm/coconut">Coconut&lt;/a>, a JIT compiler for Python using libgccjit.so. It is incomplete and experimental.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Drawback: currently have to write out a .s to a file and invoke gcc on it.&lt;br />Some might make a cheeky comment about the benefits of architecting a compiler so it can be used as a library, but I of course wouldn't dare. The good news is the speaker is actively looking at what would be needed to use GAS and GNU ld as a library.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h4>Introduction to new Intel SIMD ISA and its impact on GCC&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>&lt;li>AVX-512 offers 64 simple precision or 32 double precision floating point operations per cycle. It also has 8x64-bit mask registers.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Rounding modes can be set on a per-instruction process&lt;/li>&lt;li>Basic support is available from GCC 4.9.x.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h4>News from Sanitizers&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>&lt;li>MemorySanitizer detects use of uninitialized memory. Increases CPU by about 2.5x and RAM by 2x. Was released in LLVM in 2013. It is currently Linux/x86-64 only.&lt;/li>&lt;li>History growth is limited by limiting the history depth and the number of new history nodes per stack trace.&lt;/li>&lt;li>MSan has found hundreds of bugs across Google internal code, Chromium, LLVM, etc. It was more challenging for Chromium due to the number of system libs that had to be rebuilt.&lt;/li>&lt;li>AddressSanitizer annotations allows you to detect access to the regions of e.g. &lt;code>std::vector&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code> which has been allocated as part of its capacity but not yet been used (i.e. will start to be used in the next &lt;code>push_back&lt;/code>). Next is to do the same for &lt;code>std::string&lt;/code> and &lt;code>std::deque&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Glibc uses GNU-C instead of ANSI C which currently prevents compilation with Clang (nested functions in particular are problematic). It can however be built with ASan by GCC.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Evgeniy comments that the lack of standardisation between Clang and GCC for things like &lt;code>__has_feature(address_sanitizer)&lt;/code> vs &lt;code>__SANITIZE_ADDRESS__&lt;/code> is irritating. This is just the sort of thing Renato was talking about yesterday of course.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h4>glibc performance tuning&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>&lt;li>Use memset as an example. Look at 3 variants.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Writing a useful benchmark is more difficult than you might think. Simply running &lt;code>memset&lt;/code> many times in a loop is not a good benchmark when using the same memory locations due to the processor's load-store forwarding. Even when fixing this, the branch predictor may perform much better than it would when memset is used in a real world scenario and lead to unrepresentative results.&lt;/li>&lt;li>To move beyond microbenchmarks, Ondrej has been using &lt;code>LD_PRELOAD&lt;/code> to link against instrumented versions of the functions which record details about the time taken.&lt;/li>&lt;li>See &lt;a href="http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~ondra/benchmark_string/i7_nehalem/memset_profile/results_gcc/result.html">here&lt;/a>for memset benchmarks and &lt;a href="http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~ondra/benchmark_string/i7_nehalem/memset_profile/results_gcc/doc/properties.html">here&lt;/a> for more background.&lt;/li>&lt;li>strcmp was the most frequently called glibc function in Ondrej's testing (when running Firefox).&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h4>Devirtualization in GCC&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>&lt;li>This is a special case of indirect call removal, and although the talk is given in the context of C++ the techniques apply to other languages too. Some basic cases are handled in the front-end and even specified by the language standard.&lt;/li>&lt;li>It is a special case of constant propagation across aggregates, which is already done by Global Value Numbering and Interprocedural Constant Propagation. But these passes only catch a tiny number of possible cases.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Loss of information between the frontend and middle end can make some cases almost impossible. The intermediate language can be extended with explicit representations of base types, locations of virtual table pointers, and vtables. Also annotate polymorphic calls specifying instance and polymorphic call type and flags to denote constructors/destructors.&lt;/li>&lt;li>I'm not able to summarise details on the GCC devirt implementation better than the slides do. Hopefully they'll be made available online.&lt;/li>&lt;li>A particular challenge is to match types between different compilation units. The C++ One Definition Rule is used.&lt;/li>&lt;li>It can be used to strengthen unreachable function removal.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Feedback-directed devirtualization was extended in GCC 4.9 to work inter-module with LTO.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>FTL: WebKit’s LLVM based JIT</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2014 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html</guid><description>
Over the past year, the WebKit project made tremendous progress on the ability to optimize JavaScript applications. A major part of that effort was the introduction of the Fourth Tier LLVM (FTL) JIT. The Fourth Tier JIT targets long-running JavaScript content and performs a level of optimization beyond WebKit's interpreter, baseline JIT, and high-level optimizing JIT. See the FTL Optimization Strategy section below for more on WebKit's tiered optimizations. The engineering advancements within WebKit that made the FTL possible were described by Filip Pizlo in the Surfin' Safari Blog post, &lt;a href="http://www.webkit.org/blog/3362/introducing-the-webkit-ftl-jit/">Introducing the WebKit FTL JIT&lt;/a>. On April 29, 2014, the WebKit team enabled FTL by default on trunk: &lt;a href="http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/167958">r167958&lt;/a>. &lt;p/>This achievement also represents a significant milestone for the LLVM community. FTL makes it clear that LLVM can be used to accelerate a dynamically type checked languages in a competitive production environment. This in itself is a tremendous success story and shows the advantage of the highly modular and flexible design of LLVM. It is the first time that the LLVM infrastructure has supported self-modifying code, and the first time profile guided information has been used inside the LLVM JIT. Even though this project pioneered new territory for LLVM, it was in no way an academic exercise. To be successful, FTL must perform at least as well as non-FTL JavaScript engines in use today across a range of workloads without compromising reliability. This post describes the technical aspects of that accomplishment that relate to LLVM and future opportunities for LLVM to improve JIT compilation and the LLVM infrastructure overall. &lt;p/> Read on for more information.&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html#ftl-performance">FTL Performance&lt;/a> &lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html#ftl-optimization-strategy">FTL Optimization Strategy&lt;/a> &lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html#llvm-patch-points">LLVM Patch Points&lt;/a> &lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html#ftl-style-llvm-ir">FTL-Style LLVM IR&lt;/a> &lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html#mcjit-and-the-llvm-c-api">MCJIT and the LLVM C API&lt;/a> &lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html#linking-webkit-with-llvm">Linking WebKit with LLVM&lt;/a> &lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html#ftl-efficiency">FTL Efficiency&lt;/a> &lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html#optimization-improvements">Optimization Improvements&lt;/a> &lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html#extending-patch-points">Extending Patch Points&lt;/a> &lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html#conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/a>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h2>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html" name="ftl-performance">FTL Performance&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>JavaScript pages are ubiquitous and users expect fast load times, which WebKit's architecture is well suited for. However, some JavaScript applications require nontrivial computation and may run for periods longer than one hundred milliseconds. These applications demand aggressive compiler optimization and code generation tuned for the target CPU. FTL brings the full gamut of compiler technology to bear on the problem. &lt;p/>As with any high level language, high level optimizations must come first. Grafting an optimizing compiler backend onto an immature frontend would be futile. The marriage of WebKit's JIT with LLVM's optimizer and code generation works for two key reasons: &lt;p/>&lt;ol>&lt;li>Before translating to LLVM IR, WebKit's optimizing JIT operates on an IR that clearly expresses JavaScript semantics. Through type inference and profile-driven speculation, WebKit removes as much of the JavaScript abstraction penalty as possible. &lt;/li>&lt;li>LLVM IR has now adopted features for supporting speculative, profile-driven optimization and avoiding the performance penalty associated with abstractions when they cannot be removed. &lt;/li>&lt;/ol>As a result, WebKit can engage the FTL on any long-running JavaScript method. In areas of the code dominated by abstraction overhead, FTL-compiled code is at least competitive with that of a custom JIT designed specifically for JavaScript. In areas of the code where WebKit can remove the abstraction penalty, FTL can achieve fantastic speedups. &lt;p/>Asm.js is a subset if JavaScript that avoids abstraction penalties, allowing JITs to directly benefit from low-level performance optimization. Consequently, the performance advantage of FTL is likely to be quite apparent on asm.js benchmarks. But although FTL performs well on asm.js, it is in no way customized to the standard. In fact, with FTL, regular JavaScript code written in a style similar to asm.js will derive the same benefits. Furthermore, as WebKit's high-level optimizations become even more advanced, the benefits of FTL will expand to a broader set of idiomatic JavaScript code. &lt;p/>A convenient way to measure the impact of LLVM optimizations on JavaScript code is by running C/C++ benchmarks that have been compiled to asm.js code via emscripten. This allows us to compare native C/C++ performance with WebKit's third tier (DFG) compiler and with WebKit FTL. &lt;p/>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--gmTvH6H5ho/U8XprFD79_I/AAAAAAAAG1I/spxgXk6WL4M/s1600/asm_js_ftl_results.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--gmTvH6H5ho/U8XprFD79_I/AAAAAAAAG1I/spxgXk6WL4M/s1600/asm_js_ftl_results.png" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;b>Figure 1&lt;/b>: Time to run benchmarks from LLVM test-suite.&lt;/div>Figure 1 shows the time taken to run a handful of benchmarks from LLVM's own test-suite. The benchmark workloads have been adjusted to run for approximately one second. In every case, FTL achieves significant improvement over WebKit's non-LLVM JIT (DFG). In some cases, the emscripten compiled JavaScript code is already approaching native C performance, but in other cases FTL code still takes about twice as long as clang compiled C code&lt;b>[1]&lt;/b>. One reason for the discrepancy between clang and FTL is the call overhead required for maintaining the JavaScript runtime's additional frame information. Another reason is that LLVM loop optimizations are not yet sophisticated enough to remove bounds and overflow checks and thus have not been enabled. These benchmarks are very tight loops, so a minor inefficiency, such as an extra compare or store in the loop, can result in a significant slowdown. &lt;p/>&lt;b>[1]&lt;/b> gcc-loops is currently an outlier because clang performance recently sped up dramatically from auto-vectorization that has not been enabled yet in FTL. &lt;p/>&lt;h2>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html" name="ftl-optimization-strategy">FTL Optimization Strategy&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>WebKit's tiered architecture provides flexibility in balancing responsiveness, profile collection, and compiler optimization. The first tier is the low-level interpreter (LLInt). The second is the baseline JIT--a straightforward translation from JavaScript to machine code. WebKit's third tier is known as the Data Flow Graph (DFG) JIT. The DFG has its own high-level IR allowing it to perform aggressive JavaScript-specific optimization based on the profile data collected in earlier tiers. When running as a third tier, the DFG quickly emits code with additional profiling hooks. It may be invoked again as a fourth tier, but this time it produces LLVM IR for traditional compiler optimization. &lt;p/>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-anUsfTvvZCs/U8XtyOp5l-I/AAAAAAAAG1Y/qjoH0nTncE0/s1600/ftl_pipeline.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-anUsfTvvZCs/U8XtyOp5l-I/AAAAAAAAG1Y/qjoH0nTncE0/s1600/ftl_pipeline.png" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;b>Figure 2.&lt;/b> The DFG and FTL JIT optimization pipelines (from &lt;a href="http://www.webkit.org/blog/3362/introducing-the-webkit-ftl-jit/">Introducing the WebKit FTL JIT&lt;/a>). &lt;/div>We reuse most of the DFG phases. The new FTL pipeline is a drop-in replacement for the third-tier DFG backend. It involves additional JavaScript-aware optimizations over DFG SSA form, followed by a phase that lowers DFG IR to LLVM IR. We then invoke LLVM's optimization pipeline and LLVM's MCJIT backend to generate machine code. &lt;p/>The DFG JIT front end generates LLVM IR in a form that is amenable to the same optimizations traditionally performed with C code.

It then invokes the LLVM backend for the host architecture with full optimization. This optimizes the code for the target CPU using aggressive instruction selection, register allocation, and machine-specific optimization. &lt;p/>&lt;h2>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html" name="llvm-patch-points">LLVM Patch Points&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>Patch points are the key LLVM feature that allows dynamic type checking, inline caching, and runtime safety checks without penalizing performance. In October, 2013, we submitted a &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2013-October/066573.html">proposal to amend LLVM IR with patch points&lt;/a> to the LLVM developer list. Since then, we've successfully implemented patch points for multiple architectures and their performance impact has been validated for various use cases, including branch-to-fail safety checks, inline caches, and code invalidation points. The details of the current design are explained in the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/StackMaps.html">LLVM specification of stack map and patch point intrinsics&lt;/a>. &lt;p/>Patch points are actually two features in one intrinsic. The first feature is the ability to identify the location of specific values at the intrinsic's final instruction address. During code emission, LLVM records that information as meta-data alongside the object code in what we call a "stack map". A stack map communicates to the runtime the location of important values. This is a slight misnomer given that locations may refer to register names. Typically, the runtime will read values out of stack map locations when it needs to reconstruct a stack frame. This commonly occurs during "deoptimization"--the process of replacing an FTL stack frame with a lower-tier frame. &lt;p/>The second feature of patch points is the ability of the runtime to patch the compiled code at specific instruction address. To allow this, the intrinsic reserves a fixed amount of instruction encoding space and records the instruction address of that space along with the stack map. Because the runtime needs to know the location of values precisely at the point it patches code, the two features must be combined into one intrinsic. &lt;p/>Patch points are viewed by LLVM passes much like unknown call sites. An important aspect of their design is the ability to specify the effective calling convention. For example, code invalidation points are almost never taken and the call site should not clobber any registers, otherwise the register allocator could be severely restricted by frequent runtime checks. An optional feature of stack maps is the ability to record the registers that are actually live in compiled code at each call site. This way the JIT can declare a call as preserving all registers to maximize compiler freedom, but at the same time the runtime can avoid unnecessary save and restore operations when the "cold" call is actually taken. &lt;p/>To better support inline cache optimizations, LLVM now has a special "anyregcc" calling convention. This convention allows any number of arguments to be forced into registers without pinning down the name of the register. Consequently, the compiler does not have to place arguments in particular registers or stack locations, or emit extra copies and spills around call sites, and the runtime can emit efficient patched code sequences that operate directly on registers. &lt;p/>The current patch point design is labeled experimental so that it may continue to evolve without preserving bitcode compatibility. LLVM should soon be ready to adopt the patch point intrinsic in its final form. However, the current design should first be extended to capture the semantics of high level language runtime checks. See Extending Patchpoints. &lt;p/>&lt;h2>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html" name="ftl-style-llvm-ir">FTL-Style LLVM IR&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>FTL attempts to generate LLVM IR that closely resembles what the optimizer expects to see from other typical compiler frontends. Nonetheless, lowering JavaScript semantics into LLVM operations tends to result in IR with different characteristics from statically compiled C code. This section summarizes those differences. More details and examples will be provided in a subsequent blog post. &lt;p/>The prevalence of patch points in the IR means that values tend to have many more uses and can be live into a large number of patch point call sites. FTL emits patch points for a few distinct situations. First, when the FTL front end (DFG) fails to eliminate type checks or bounds checks, it emits explicit compare and branch operations in the IR. The branch target lands at a patch point intrinsic followed by unreachable. This can result in much more branchy code than LLVM typically handles with C benchmarks. Fortunately, LLVM's awareness of branch probability means that the branch-to-fail idiom does not excessively hinder optimization and code generation. Heap access and polymorphic calls also use patch points, but these are emitted directly inline with the hot path. This allows the runtime to implement inline caches with specific instruction sequences that can be patched as program behavior evolves. Finally, runtime calls may act as code invalidation points. A runtime event, such as a potential change in object layout, may invalidate speculatively optimized code. In this case WebKit emits nop patch points that can be overwritten with a separate runtime call at an invalidation event. This effectively invalidates all code that follows the original runtime call. &lt;p/>Some type checks result in multiple fast paths. For example, WebKit may check a numeric value for either a floating-point or fixed point representation and emit LLVM IR for both paths. This may result in a sequence of redundant checks interleaved with control flow merges. &lt;p/>To support integer overflow checks, when they cannot be removed through optimization, FTL emits llvm.sadd.with.overflow intrinsics in place of normal add instructions. These intrinsics ensure that the code generator produces an optimal code sequence for the overflow checks. They are also used by other active LLVM projects and are gradually gaining support within LLVM optimization passes. &lt;p/>LLVM heuristics are often sufficient to guess branch probability. However FTL makes the job easier by directly emitting LLVM branch weight meta-data based on profiling. This is particularly important when partially compiling a method starting at the inner loop. Such compilations can squash nested loops so that LLVM's heuristics can no longer infer the loop depth from the CFG structure. &lt;p/>FTL builds an internal model of the JavaScript program's type system determined by profiling. It conveys this information to LLVM via type-based-alias-analysis (tbaa) meta-data. In FTL tbaa, each object field has a unique tag. This is a very effective approach to memory disambiguation, and much simpler than the access-path scheme that clang now uses. &lt;p/>Another way that FTL deviates from the norm, is in its use of inttoptr instructions. These are used to materialize addresses of runtime objects, including all data and code from outside the current compilation unit (currently a single method at a time). inttoptr is also used to convert an untyped JS value to a pointer. Occasionally, pointer arithmetic is performed on non-pointer types rather than using getelementptr instructions. This is primarily a convenience and has not proven to hinder optimization. FTL's use of tbaa is effective enough to obviate the need to analyze getelementptr when the base address is already an unknown object. &lt;p/>An important pattern that occurs in FTL's LLVM IR is the repeated use of the same large constants that are used as masks to disambiguate tagged values, or several constants that represent global addresses that tend to be at small offsets from each other. LLVM's current one basic block a time code generation approach resulted in redundant rematerialization of the same large constant in each basic block. The fact that FTL creates a large number of basic blocks even further exacerbated this problem. The LLVM code generator has been enhanced to avoid these expensive repeated rematerialization of such constant values. &lt;p/>&lt;h2>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html" name="mcjit-and-the-llvm-c-api">MCJIT and the LLVM C API&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>The FTL JIT successfully leverages LLVM's existing &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/MCJITDesignAndImplementation.html">MCJIT framework&lt;/a> for runtime compilation. MCJIT was designed as a low-level toolkit that allows runtime compilers to be built by reusing as much of the static compiler's machinery as possible. This approach improves maintainability on the LLVM side. It integrates with the existing compiler toolchain and allows developers to test features of the runtime compiler without understanding a particular JIT client. The current API, however, does not provide a simple out-of-the-box abstraction for portable JITs. Overcoming the impedance mismatch between WebKit goals and the low-level MCJIT API required close collaboration between WebKit and LLVM engineers. As LLVM becomes more important as a JIT platform, it should provide a more complete C API to improve interoperability with JIT clients and decrease the fragility and maintenance burden within the client code base. &lt;p/>Bridging the gap between LLVM internals and portable JITs can be accomplished by providing more convenience wrappers around the existing MCJIT framework and adding richer C APIs for object code parsing and introspection. Ideally, a cross-platform JIT client like WebKit should not need to embed target-specific details about LLVM code generation on the client side. The JIT should be able to request LLVM to emit code for the current host process without understanding LLVM's language of target triples and CPU features. LLVM could generally provide a more obvious C API for lazily invoking runtime compilation. Along these lines, a JIT should be able to reuse the MCJIT execution engine for multiple modules without the overhead of reinitializing pass manager instances each time. An API also needs to be added for configuring the code generation pass manager. Most of the coordination between the JIT and LLVM now occurs directly through a memory manager API, which can be awkward for the JIT client. For example, WebKit looks for platform-specific section names when allocating section memory in order to locate frame meta-data and debug information. A better interface for WebKit would be a portable API that communicates object code meta-data, including frame information and stack maps. In general, the JIT codebase should not need to provide its own support for platform-specific object file formats. LLVM already has this support, it only needs to be exposed through the C API. Similarly, a JIT should be able to lookup line numbers without implementing its own DWARF parser. An additional layer of functionality for general purpose debug info parsing and object code introspection would not be specific to JIT compilation and could benefit a variety of LLVM clients. &lt;p/>&lt;h2>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html" name="linking-webkit-with-llvm">Linking WebKit with LLVM&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>FTL illustrates an important use case for LLVM: embedding LLVM optimization and codegen libraries cleanly within a larger application running in the same process. The ideal solution is to build a set of LLVM components as a shared library that exports only a limited C API. Several problems have made this a challenging endeavor: &lt;ul>&lt;li>The dynamic link time initialization overhead of the static initializers that LLVM defines is unacceptable at program launch time - especially if only parts of the library or nothing at all are used. &lt;/li>&lt;li>LLVM initializes global variables that require running exit-time destructors. This causes a multi-threaded parent application that attempts to exit normally to crash instead. &lt;/li>&lt;li>As with static initializers, weak vtables introduce an unnecessary and unacceptable dynamic link time overhead. &lt;/li>&lt;li>In general only a limited set of methods - the LLVM API - should be exported from the shared library. &lt;/li>&lt;li>LLVM usurps process-level API calls like assert, raise, and abort. &lt;/li>&lt;li>The resulting size of the LLVM shared library naively built from static libraries is larger than it needs to be. Build logic and conditional compilation should be added to ensure that only the passes and platform support required by the JIT client are ultimately linked into the shared library. &lt;/li>&lt;/ul>The issues listed above have required clever engineering tricks to circumvent. These are the sort of tricks that hinder adoption of LLVM. Therefore it would be in the best interest of the LLVM community to cooperate on improving the infrastructure for embedding LLVM. &lt;p/>&lt;h2>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html" name="ftl-efficiency">FTL Efficiency&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>The LLVM optimizer and code generator are composed of generic, retargetable components designed to generate optimal code across an extremely diverse range of platforms. The compile time cost of this infrastructure is substantial and may be an order of magnitude greater than that of a custom-built JIT. Fortunately, WebKit's architecture for concurrent, tiered compilation largely sidesteps this penalty. Nonetheless, there is considerable opportunity to reengineer LLVM for use as a JIT, which will decrease FTL's CPU consumption and increase the breadth of JavaScript applications that benefit from FTL. &lt;p/>When running in a JIT environment, an opportunity exists for LLVM to strike a better balance between compile time and optimization strength. To this end, an alternate "compile-fast" optimization pass pipeline should be standardized so that the LLVM community can work together to maintain an ideal sequence of lighter-weight passes. Long running, iterative IR optimization passes, such as GVN, should be adapted to optionally run in fewer iterations. Hodge-podge passes like InstCombine that run many times should be optionally broken up so that some subset of functionality can run at different times: for example, canonicalize first and optimize later. &lt;p/>There are also considerable opportunities for improving code generation efficiency which will benefit JITs and static compilers alike. LLVM machine IR should be generated directly from LLVM IR without generating a Selection DAG, as proposed by Jakob Olesen in his &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2013-August/064727.html">Proposal for a global instruction selector&lt;/a>. The benefit of this improvement would be considerable and widespread. More specific to high level languages, codegen passes should be tuned to handle branchy code more efficiently. For example, the register allocator can be taught to skip expensive analysis at points in the code where branches are not expected to be executed. &lt;p/>One overhead that will remain with the above improvements is simply the cost of bridging WebKit's DFG IR into LLVM IR. This involves lowering to SSA form and constructing LLVM instructions, which currently takes significant amount of time relative to DFG's non-LLVM codegen path. With some scrutiny, this could likely be made more efficient. &lt;p/>&lt;h2>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html" name="optimization-improvements">Optimization Improvements&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>Without incurring significant compile time increase, LLVM optimizations can be further improved to handle prevalent idioms in JavaScript programs. One straightforward LLVM IR enhancement would be to associate type-based alias information with call sites. This would improve redundant instruction elimination across runtime calls and patch points. Another area of improvement would be better handling of branch-and-merge idioms. These are quite common in FTL produced IR and can improved through CFG simplification, jump threading, or tail duplication. With careful pass pipeline management, loop optimizations can be enabled, such as auto-vectorization. Once LLVM is analyzing loops, bounds and overflow check elimination optimization can also be implemented. To do this well, patch points will need to be extended with new semantics. &lt;p/>&lt;h2>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html" name="extending-patch-points">Extending Patch Points&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>In settings like JavaScript and other high level languages, patch points will be used to transfer control to the runtime when speculative optimization fails in the sense that the program behaves differently than predicted. It is always safe to assume a misprediction and give control back to the runtime because the runtime always knows how to recover. Consequently, patch points could optionally be associated with a check condition and given the following semantics: the patch point code sequence must be executed whenever the condition holds, but may safely be executed at its current location under any superset of the condition. When combined with LLVM loop optimization, the conditional patch point semantics would allow powerful optimization of runtime checks. In particular, bounds and overflow checks could be safely hoisted outside loops. For example, the following simplified IR: &lt;p/>&lt;pre>&lt;code>&lt;br />%a = cmp &amp;lt;TrapConditionA&amp;gt;&lt;br />call @patchpoint(1, %a, &amp;lt;state-before-loop&amp;gt;)&lt;br />Loop:&lt;br /> %b = cmp &amp;lt;TrapConditionB&amp;gt;&lt;br /> @patchpoint(2, %b, &amp;lt;state-inside-loop&amp;gt;)&lt;br /> &amp;lt;do something...&amp;gt;&lt;br />&lt;br />Could be safely optimized into:&lt;br />&lt;br />%c = cmp &amp;lt;TrapConditionC&amp;gt; // where C implies both A and B&lt;br />@patchpoint(1, %c, &amp;lt;state-before-loop&amp;gt;)&lt;br />Loop:&lt;br /> do something...&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>Note that the first patch point operand is an identifier that tells the runtime the program location of the intrinsic, allowing it find the correct stack map record for the program state at that location. After the above optimization, not only does LLVM avoid performing repeated checks within the loop, but it also avoids maintaining additional runtime state throughout the loop body. &lt;p/>Generally, high level optimization requiring knowledge of language-specific semantics is best performed on a higher level IR. But in this case, extending LLVM with one aspect of high level semantics allows LLVM's loop and expression analysis to be directly leveraged and naturally extended into a new class of optimization. &lt;p/>&lt;h2>&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/ftl-webkits-llvm-based-jit.html" name="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>WebKit's FTL JIT already shows considerable value in improving JavaScript performance, demonstrating LLVM's remarkable success as a backend for a JavaScript JIT compiler. The FTL project highlights the value of further improving LLVM's JIT infrastructure and reveals several exciting opportunities: improved efficiency of optimization passes and codegen, optimizations targeted toward common idioms present in high level language, enabling more aggressive standard optimizations like vectorization, and extending and formalizing patch point intrinsics. Realizing these goals will require the continued support of the LLVM community and will advance and improve the LLVM project as a whole.</description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #28, Jul 14th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/llvm-weekly-28-jul-14th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2014 06:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/llvm-weekly-28-jul-14th-2014.html</guid><description>

More information is available in the author's &lt;a href="http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-105456">Master's thesis&lt;/a> (via &lt;a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=MTczODY">Phoronix&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Edward Diener has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/37699">kicked off a discussion on whether clang-cl should reproduce buggy VC++ preprocessor behaviour&lt;/a>. A concern is that this might hold back people wanting to use preprocessor metaprogramming on the Windows platform. As is pointed out in one of the responses, bug-for-bug compatibility mode could always be disabled via a new flag.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Corey Richardson has a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/37761">query about using clang-c for a bindings generator&lt;/a>. No responses yet, but it's certainly of interest to me.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Kuba Břečka &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74718">proposes extending LLDB to offer tighter integration with Address Sanitizer-enabled binaries&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Peter Collingbourne has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74602">proposed offering a native object on-disk module format storing LLVM bitcode in an ELF/COFF/MACH-O section&lt;/a>. Dan Liew &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74641">points out that unrecognised sections are included in the output by the linker&lt;/a>, meaning if you linked these .o files the bitcode would be included in the produced binary. Peter says the current plan wouldn't have these object files used directly by the linker.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>FastISel gained some infrastructure to support a target-independent call lowering hook as well as target-independent lowering for the patchpoint intrinsic. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212848">r212848&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212849">r212849&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>DominanceFrontier has been templatified, so in theory it can now be used for MachineBasicBlocks (where previously it was only usable with BasicBlocks). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212885">r212885&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The quality of results for CallSite vs CallSite BasicAA queries has been improved by making use of knowledge about certain intrinsics such as memcpy and memset. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212572">r212572&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Work on overhauling x86 vector lowering continues. Chandler now reports that with the new codepath enabled, LLVM is now at performance pairty with GCC for the core C loops of the x264 code when compiling for SSE2/SSE3. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212610">r212610&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>ASM instrumentation for AddressSanitizer is now generated entirely in MachineCode, without relying on runtime helper functions. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212455">r212455&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Generation of the new mips.abiflags section was added to the MIPS backend. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212519">r212519&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>isDereferenceablePointer will now look through some bitcasts. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212686">r212686&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new checker was added, to flag code that tests a variable for 0 after using it as a denominator (implying a potential division by zero). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212731">r212731&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang gained initial support for omp parallel for, the omp parallel sections directive, and omp task. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212453">r212453&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212516">r212516&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212804">r212804&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>On the ARM target, LLVM's atomicrmw instructions will be used when ldrex/strex are available. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212598">r212598&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support was adding for mips-img-linux-gnu toolchains. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212719">r212719&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>ThreadSanitizer's deadlock detector is enabled by default after being battle-tested on the Chromium codebase for some time. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212533">r212533&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for Android's bionic C library has been added to libcxx. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212724">r212724&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLDB's Python scripting interface should now work on Windows. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL212785">r212785&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Clang/LLVM on Windows Update</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/clangllvm-on-windows-update.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2014 20:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/clangllvm-on-windows-update.html</guid><description>

Each version of Visual Studio changes the ABI slightly. &amp;nbsp;As of today clang-cl is layout compatible with VS2013.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;b style="font-weight: normal;">&lt;br />&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Clang now supports all of the calling conventions used up to VS2012. &amp;nbsp;VS2013 added some new ones that we haven’t implemented yet. &amp;nbsp;One of the other major compatibility challenges we overcame was passing C++ objects by value on 32-bit x86. &amp;nbsp;Prior to this effort, LLVM modeled all outgoing arguments as SSA values, making it impossible to take the address of an argument to a call. &amp;nbsp;It turns out that on Windows C++ objects passed by value are constructed directly into the argument memory used for the function call. &amp;nbsp;Achieving 100% compatibility in this area required making fundamental changes to LLVM IR to allow us to compute this address.&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;b style="font-weight: normal;">&lt;br />&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Most recently support for run time type information (RTTI) was completed. &amp;nbsp;With RTTI support, a larger set of programs and libraries (for example &lt;/span>&lt;a href="http://site.icu-project.org/" style="text-decoration: none;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: #1155cc; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">ICU&lt;/span>&lt;/a>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">) compile without fallback and dynamic_cast and typeid both work. &amp;nbsp;RTTI support also brings along support for std::function. &amp;nbsp;We also recently added support for lambdas so you can enjoy all of the C++11 functional goodness!&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">We invite you to &lt;/span>&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/builds/" style="text-decoration: none;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: #1155cc; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">try it out for yourself&lt;/span>&lt;/a>&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> and, as always, we encourage everyone to file bugs!&lt;/span>&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #27, Jul 7th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/llvm-weekly-27-jul-7th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2014 07:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/07/llvm-weekly-27-jul-7th-2014.html</guid><description>

The blog post tells us that McSema will be open source and made available soon.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Bruce Mitchener has written up his &lt;a href="http://dylanfoundry.org/2014/06/25/integrating-with-lldb/">experience of integrating with LLDB for Dylan&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Codeplay (based in Edinburgh) are advertising for a &lt;a href="http://www.codeplay.com/company/jobs/view.html?uid=12#.U7B4jzksa00">full time compiler engineer&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Alp Toker kicked off a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74274">long thread about the use of Phabricator for code reviews&lt;/a>. The main problem is that Phabricator reviews aren't necessarily going through llvm-commits which is potentially harming development. A very sensible step has been taken of &lt;a href="https://secure.phabricator.com/T5495">filing a feature request with Phabricator&lt;/a> for the ability to warn when no mailing list is subscribed to a code review.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>James Molloy has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74269">shared some rough benchmark data on LLVM targeting Cortex-A57&lt;/a>. For SPEC, LLVM is apparently less than 5% behind GCC for most benchmarks. James also lists a number of missed optimisation opportunities he's noticed so far in comparing the output.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Alexander Kornienko &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74314">questions whether it's time to bump the minimum Python requirement from 2.5 to 2.7&lt;/a>. Replies o the thread made the distinction between the minimum to run tests using lit (which is written in Python) and the minimum for tooling scripts that may need to be less portable. Despite 2.5 being ancient, the reason for wanting to support it is for long-lived releases such as RHEL.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Diego Novillo &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74351">suggests turning on debug column info by default&lt;/a>. He found almost no difference in compile time and only a 1% growth in debug info size. There seems to be support for doing this, with the only concern being that some debuggers might not interpret the data properly leading to odd behaviour. David Blaikie found a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/74376">few regressions in the gdb test suite&lt;/a>, but has yet to investigate further.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A significant overhaul of how vector lowering is done in the x86 backend has been started. While it's under development it's off by default, though it's hoped that in times there will be measurable performance improvements on benchmarks conducive to vectorization. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211888">r211888&lt;/a> and more.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>X86 FastISel will use EFLAGS directly when lowering select instructions if the condition comes from a compare. It also now supports floating-point selects among other improvements. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211543">r211543&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211544">r211544&lt;/a>, and more.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>ScaledNumber has been split out from BlockFrequencyInfo into the Support library. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211562">r211562&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The loop vectorizer now features &lt;code>-Rpass-missed&lt;/code> and &lt;code>-Rpass-analysis&lt;/code> reports. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211721">r211721&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The developer documentation has been updated to clarify that although you can use Phabricator to submit code for review, you should also ensure the relevant -commits mailing list is added as a subscriber on the review and be prepared to respond to comments there. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211731">r211731&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>COMDATs have been added to the IR. What's a COMDAT? &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2440933">StackOverflow has you covered&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211920">r211920&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The NVPTX backend saw a whole series of commits. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211930">r211930&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211932">r211932&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211935">r211935&lt;/a>, and more.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM gained an abstraction for a random number generator (RNG). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211705">r211705&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A nice little diagnostic improvement has been added for when the user accidentally puts braces before the identifer, e.g. &lt;code>int [4] foo;&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211641">r211641&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>OpenMP learned the 'section' directive (and some more, see the full commit logs). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211685">r211685&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211767">r211767&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for ARM EHABI unwinding was added to libunwind. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211743">r211743&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The lldb Machine Interface gained a number of new commands and bug fixes. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211607">r211607&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #25, Jun 23rd 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/06/llvm-weekly-25-jun-23rd-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2014 03:31:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/06/llvm-weekly-25-jun-23rd-2014.html</guid><description>

This includes plugins to the clang analyzer primarily for iOS development as well as a plugin to export the Clang AST to JSON. The code is &lt;a href="https://github.com/facebook/facebook-clang-plugins">available on Github&lt;/a> and they have started a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/37318">discussion on the mailing list&lt;/a> about moving some of this code upstream.&lt;/p>&lt;p>This week saw the &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvm-announce/2014-June/000053.html">release&lt;/a> of LLVM and Clang 3.4.2. This is a bug-fix release which maintains ABI and API compatibility with 3.4.1.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Clang's C++ status page &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html#cxx17">now lists C++1z feature status&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Rafael Espíndola has started a thread to discuss &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73948">clarification on the backward compatibility promises of LLVM&lt;/a>. He summarises what seems to be the current policy (old .bc is upgraded upon read, there is no strong guarantee on .ll compatibility). Much of the subsequent discussion is about issues such as compatibility with metadata format changes.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Duncan P.N. Exon Smith has posted a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73968">review of the new pass manager&lt;/a> in its current form. He starts with a high-level overview of what Chandler Carruth's new PassManager infrastructure offers and has a list of queries and concerns. There are no responses yet, but it's worth keeping your eyes on this thread if you're interested in LLVM internals development.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>This week has brought two separate proposals for LLVM code coverage support (neither of which have any replies at the time of writing). Christian Holler has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73919">proposed inclusion of LLCov code&lt;/a>. This is a module pass that instruments basic blocks with calls to functions that will track coverage. The current LLCov code is &lt;a href="https://github.com/choller/LLCov">available on Github&lt;/a>. Alex L has also posted a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/37289">detailed proposal on improving code coverage support for Clang and LLVM&lt;/a>. He is looking for feedback on the approach before starting to submit patches.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LLVM global lock is dead, and the LLVM Programmer's Manual has been updated to reflect this. &lt;code>llvm_start_multithreaded&lt;/code> and &lt;code>llvm_stop_multithreaded&lt;/code> have been removed.&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211277">r211277&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211287">r211287&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The patchset to improve MergeFunctions performance from O(NxN) to O(N x log(N)) has finally been completely merged. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211437">r211437&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211445">r211445&lt;/a> and more.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Range metadata can now be attached to call and invoke (previously it could only be attached to load). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211281">r211281&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>ConvertUTF in the Support library was modified to find the maximal subpart of an ill-formed UTF-8 sequence. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211015">r211015&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LoopUnrollPass will now respect loop unrolling hints in metadata. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211076">r211076&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The R600 backend has been updated to make use of LDS (Local Data Share) and vectors for private memory. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211110">r211110&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>X86FastISel continues to improve with optimisation for predicates, cmp folding, and support for 64-bit absolute relocations. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211126">r211126&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL211130">r211130&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The SLPVectorizer (superword-level parallelism) will now recognize and vectorize non-SIMD instruction patterns like sequences of fadd,fsub or add,sub.

Weak cmpxchg allows failure and the operation returns &lt;code>{iN, i1}&lt;/code> (in fact, for uniformity all cmpxchg instructions do this now).

&lt;p>Welcome to the twenty-third issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter (published every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related projects. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by &lt;a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex Bradbury&lt;/a>. Subscribe to future issues at &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org&lt;/a> and pass it on to anyone else you think may be interested. Please send any tips or feedback to &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#97;&amp;#115;&amp;#98;&amp;#64;&amp;#97;&amp;#115;&amp;#98;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#100;&amp;#98;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#121;&amp;#46;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;">&amp;#97;&amp;#115;&amp;#98;&amp;#64;&amp;#97;&amp;#115;&amp;#98;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#100;&amp;#98;&amp;#117;&amp;#114;&amp;#121;&amp;#46;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;&lt;/a>, or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury&lt;/a> on Twitter.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/23">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Philip Reames has &lt;a href="http://www.philipreames.com/Blog/2014/06/04/code-for-late-safepoint-placement-available/">announced that code for late safepoint placement is now available&lt;/a>.&lt;br />This is a set of patches to LLVM from Azul Systems that aim to support precise relocating garbage collection in LLVM. Phlip has a long list of questions where he is seeking feedback from the community on how to move forwards with these patches. There's not been much response so far, hopefully it will come soon as I know there are many communities who are very interested in seeing better GC support in LLVM (e.g. Rust, Ocaml).&lt;/p>&lt;p>The biggest LLVM news this week is of course the announcement of &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">the Swift programming language&lt;/a> from Apple. Its development was led by Chris Lattner, original author of LLVM. He has some more info about Swift &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">on his website&lt;/a>. There is no source release as of yet, and &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.user/493">no indication&lt;/a> from Apple as to whether it will remain proprietary. Either way, it's an interesting development. Chris Lattner is now on Twitter and has been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/474411823223959552">passing out tidbits about the Swift implementation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>LunarG have &lt;a href="http://lunarg.com/glassymesa/">announced the Glassy Mesa project&lt;/a>. This project, funded by Valve, will explore increasing game performance in Mesa through improvements in the shader compiler. The current parser and optimisation layer are replaced with glslang and the LLVM-based LunarGlass. More technical details are &lt;a href="http://media.lunarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/GlassyMesaSlides-05Jun2014.pdf">available in the slide deck&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Sébastien Métrot has released &lt;a href="https://github.com/meeloo/xspray">xspray&lt;/a>, a frontend for lldb on OS X. One of its interesting features is the inbuilt support for plotting your data.&lt;/p>&lt;p>With all the LLVM news recently, it seems &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=llvm">search traffic for 'llvm' has skyrocketed&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Zachary Tuner has started a discussion on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73604">multi-threading and mutexes in LLVM&lt;/a>, following from his patches (currently in review) that tries to replace LLVM's own mutex implementation with &lt;code>std::mutex&lt;/code> and &lt;code>std::recursive_mutex&lt;/code>. The key questions are whether multi-threading should be a compile-time or tunetime parameter, what should happen if you attempt to acquire a mutex in an app with threading disabled, and whether debugging code for finding deadlocks should be included.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Sean Silva queries &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73597">whether stack maps should be marked as stable in LLVM 3.5&lt;/a> given that the feature now has a number of users, including WebKit. Andrew Trick &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73599">suggests another round of RFC&lt;/a> before this, and intends to submit another proposal in the coming week.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Gerolf Hoflehner is &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73502">asking for feedback on his proposed instruction combiner pass&lt;/a>. This would run at the machine IR level and aims to overcome some of the deficiencies observed when combining instructions at the ISEL level.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A question has arisen over &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73465">whether LLVM 3.3/3.4 IR is backward compatible with 3.2&lt;/a>. This isn't a form of compatibility that LLVM offers, though Stephen Hines notes that &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73563">Android maintains an LLVM 3.2 bitcode writer&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Quite some time ago, Dennis Luehring drew attention to &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/31855">a case where the GCC optimiser seems to do better than Clang&lt;/a>. Benjamin Kramer and Richard Smith both submitted patches which &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/37067">now results in Clang acing this testcase&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The jumptable attribute has been introduced. If you mark a function with this attribute, references to it can be rewritten with a reference to the appropriate jump-instruction-table function pointer. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL210280">r210280&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support was added for Windows ARM exception handling data structures, including decoding them. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL209998">r209998&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL210192">r210192&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>GlobalAlias can now point to an arbitrary ConstantExpression. See the commit message for a discussion of the consequences of this. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL210062">r210062&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The subword level parallelism (SLP) vectorizer has been extended to support vectorization of getelementptr expressions. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL210342">r210342&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LLVM programmer's manual has been improved with an example of using IRBuilder. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL210354">r210354&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Semantic analysis to make sure a loop is in OpenMP canonical form has been committed. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL210095">r210095&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;code>__builtin_operator_new&lt;/code> and &lt;code>__builtin_operator_delete&lt;/code> have been added. Some optimisations are allowed on these which would not be on &lt;code>::operator new&lt;/code> and are intended for the implementation of things like std::allocator. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL210137">r210137&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>New pragmas have been introduced to give optimisation hints for vectorization and interleaving. You can now use &lt;code>#pragma clang loop vectorize(enable)&lt;/code> as well as &lt;code>vectorize(disable)&lt;/code>, &lt;code>vectorize_width(n)&lt;/code>, &lt;code>interleave(enable/disable)&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>interleave_count(n)&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL210330">r210330&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for the MSVC++ ABI continues with the addition of &lt;code>dynamic_cast&lt;/code> for MS. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL210377">r210377&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for global named registers has been expanded slightly to allow pointer types to be held in these variables. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL210274">r210274&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>GCC's &lt;code>-Wframe-larger-than=bytes&lt;/code> diagnostic is now supported. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL210293">r210293&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A benchmarking-only mode has been added to the testsuite &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL210251">r210251&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A &lt;a href="http://libcxx.llvm.org/ts1z_status.html">status page&lt;/a> for post-C++14 features in libcxx has been added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL210056">r210056&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>An initial set of Makefiles has been committed to lld. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL210177">r210177&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>lldb gained support for inspecting enum members. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL210046">r210046&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Polly can now be built without any GPLed software. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL210176">r210176&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #22, Jun 2nd 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/06/llvm-weekly-22-jun-2nd-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2014 07:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/06/llvm-weekly-22-jun-2nd-2014.html</guid><description>

I am however disturbed that all mailing lists on &lt;a href="http://gmane.org/">GMANE&lt;/a> don't seem to have been updated for the past week and have been unable to find any explanation of what is going on online. GMANE is an important and massively useful aggregrator and archiver of free software development lists and I really hope these are only temporary problems. For this issue, I have instead linked directly to the mailman archives at UIUC.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/21">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Jonathan Mah has written a &lt;a href="http://devetc.org/code/2014/05/17/safe-and-sane-key-paths.html">Clang plugin for checking key path strings in Objective C code&lt;/a>. The implementation is &lt;a href="https://github.com/jmah/Clang-KeyPathValidator">available on Github&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>LWN has published an &lt;a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/598486/">article about ThreadSanitizer v2&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>This week, the merge of the AArch64 and the Apple-contributed ARM64 backends was completed.

David Chisnall has a good followup which explains &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2014-May/073191.html">why just bitcasting floats to use atomic load/store on them is far from ideal&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Louis Gerbarg has shared an &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2014-May/073125.html">RFC on indexing of structs vs arrays in getelementpointr&lt;/a>.

I've been in San Francisco most of the week for Maker Faire this weekend, where I was at the Raspberry Pi booth with some other Foundation members. As this issue goes out, I'll be enjoying my last day in SF before heading to the airport for the long flight home and the ensuing jetlag.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/20">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The WebKit blog features an &lt;a href="https://www.webkit.org/blog/3362/introducing-the-webkit-ftl-jit/">excellent and detailed article about the new Fourth Tier LLVM JIT&lt;/a> which sheds light on the how and why.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://neu.andrometa.net/">Neu framework&lt;/a> has recently been announced. It is a C++11 framework, collection of programming languages and software system designed for artificial intelligence applications and technical computing in general. It makes use of the LLVM MC JIT for its NPL language as well as generating high performance neural networks.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Tim Northover has posted an &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73034">RFC on removing the AArch64 backend and renaming ARM64 to AArch64&lt;/a>. This would represent the culmination of the work to merge the two backends.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>In case you're wondering about when we'll see LLVM/Clang 3.5, Bill Wending has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/36750">posted to inform us the current plan is to start testing in July and target a release in August&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>I always enjoy pointing out excellent answers to questions on the mailing lists. The large and helpful community is one of the greatest assets of LLVM. This week, I draw special attention to Jordan Rose's &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/36755">answer to a question about tracking a function parameter with the static analyzer&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The testing phase for LLVM 3.4.2 &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/73069">has started&lt;/a>. According to &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72919">the schedule&lt;/a> it should be released on May 25 provided the testing phase didn't raise issues. Tom Stellard is also looking for backup release managers.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The inliner has been taught how to preserve musttail invariants. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208910">r208910&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new C API has been added for a thread yielding callback. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208945">r208945&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Another patch in the series to improve MergeFunctions performance has been committed. A total ordering has now been implemented among operations. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208973">r208973&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208976">r208976&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The ARM load/store optimisation pass has been fixed to work with Thumb1. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208992">r208992&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>GlobalValue has been split into GlobalValue and GlobalObject, which allows a code to statically accept a Function or a GlobalVariable but not an alias. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208716">r208716&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Integral reciprocal was optimised to not use division. This optimisation was influenced by &lt;a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/souper/">Souper&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208750">r208750&lt;/a>.

This is a first step towards fixing this &lt;a href="http://ericniebler.com/2014/04/27/range-comprehensions/">poor performance of these range comprehensions&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208856">r208856&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Initial support for MS ABI compliant RTTI mangling has been committed. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208661">r208661&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208509">r208668&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang will no longer copy objects with trivial, deleted copy constructors. This fixes bugs and improves ABI compatibility with GCC and MSVC. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208786">r208786&lt;/a>. Though the itanium C++ ABI part was reverted for now. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208836">r208836&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LLDB Machine Interface has been committed. This is an implementation of the &lt;a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/GDB_002fMI.html">GDB Machine Interface&lt;/a>, useful for implementing your own frontend to LLDB. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208972">r208972&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>AddressSanitizer started to gain some windows tests. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208554">r208554&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208859">r208859&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208873">r208873&lt;/a> and more.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The instrumented profiling library API was fixed to work with shared objects, and profiling is now supported for dlopened shared libraries.. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208940">r208940&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL209053">r209053&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #19, May 12th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/05/llvm-weekly-19-may-12th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2014 06:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/05/llvm-weekly-19-may-12th-2014.html</guid><description>

This is a bug-fix release so offers API and ABI compatibility with LLVM 3.4. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the release by suggesting or backporting patches, and for testing.&lt;/p>&lt;p>John Regehr has &lt;a href="http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1146">shared some early results and discussion&lt;/a> on using &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/souper/">Souper&lt;/a> (a new superoptimizer for LLVM IR) in combination with Csmith and C-reduce in order to find missed optimisations and then produce minimal test cases. This has already resulted in a &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19711">new performance bug being filed&lt;/a> with I'm sure many more to come.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/crange/crange">Crange&lt;/a>, a tool to index and cross-reference C/C++ source code built on top of Clang has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/36677">been released&lt;/a>. It aims to offer a more complete database than e.g. ctags, though the running time on a large codebase like the Linux kernel is currently very high.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/go-llvm/llgo">llgo&lt;/a>, the LLVM-based compiler for Go is &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/llgo-dev/8uBfmIkGM88/discussion">now self-hosting&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Last week I asked for benchmarks of the new &lt;a href="https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/FTLJIT">JavascriptCore Fourth Tier LLVM JIT&lt;/a>.

It's likely the final switchover will take place this week, with AArch64 being deleted and ARM64 renamed to AArch64. Ana Pazos &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.cvs/187546">shared a list of bugs currently waiting to be squashed&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Andy Lutomirski &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/36685">requests that the llvm integer arithmetic with overflow intrinsics be exposed as C intrinsics&lt;/a>. It was pointed out that they &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html#checked-arithmetic-builtins">actually are exposed&lt;/a> though Google is doing a poor job of indexing this fact, and in response a &lt;a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61129">bug has been filed with GCC&lt;/a> to expose similar intrinsics.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Suminda Dharmasena &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72850">kicked off a conversation about reducing or removing platform specific LLVM instructions&lt;/a>.

A build of clang now ends up with 470k calls in the IR marked as tail vs 375k before. The total tail call to loop conversions remains the same though. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL208017">r208017&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;code>llvm::function_ref&lt;/code> has been introduced and described in the LLVM programmers manual.

Right now, only the stack pointer is supported.

LLVM 3.4.1 has been released!&amp;nbsp; This is a bug-fix release that contains fixes for the AArch64, ARM, PowerPC, R600, and X86 targets as well as a number of other fixes in the core libraries.&lt;br />&lt;br />The LLVM and Clang core libraries in this release are API and ABI compatible with LLVM 3.4, so projects that make use of the LLVM and Clang API and libraries will not need to make any changes in order to take advantage of the 3.4.1 release.&lt;br />&lt;br />Bug-fix releases like this are very important for the project, because they help get critical fixes to users faster than the typical 6 month release cycle, and also make it easier for operating system distributors who in the past have had to track and apply bug fixes on their own.&lt;br />&lt;br />A lot of work went into this release, and special thanks should be given to all the testers who helped to qualify the release:&lt;br />&lt;br />Renato Golin&lt;br />Sebastian Dreßler&lt;br />Ben Pope&lt;br />Arnaud Allard de Grandmaison&lt;br />Erik Verbruggen&lt;br />Hal Finkel&lt;br />Nikola Smiljanic&lt;br />Hans Wennborg&lt;br />Sylvestre Ledru&lt;br />David Fang&lt;br />&lt;br />In addition there were a number community members who spent time tracking down bugs and helping to resolve merge conflicts in the 3.4 branch.&amp;nbsp; This is what made this release possible, so thanks to everyone&lt;br />else who helped.&lt;br />&lt;br />I would like to keep the trend of stable releases going to 3.5.x and beyond (Maybe even 3.4.2 if there is enough interest), but this can only be&lt;br />done with the help of the community.&amp;nbsp; If you would like to help with the next stable release or even regular release, then the next time you see a proposed release schedule on the mailing list, let the release manager know you can help.&amp;nbsp; We can never have too many volunteers.&lt;br />&lt;br />Thanks again to everyone who helped make this release possible.&lt;br />&lt;br />-Tom&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br /></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #18, May 5th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/05/llvm-weekly-18-may-5th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2014 09:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/05/llvm-weekly-18-may-5th-2014.html</guid><description>

The code for the checker described in the blog post is &lt;a href="https://github.com/awruef/find-heartbleed">available on Github&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The FTL ('Fourth tier LLVM') Javascript JIT is &lt;a href="https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/167958">now enabled in WebKit for Mac&lt;/a>. The WebKit Wiki has &lt;a href="https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/FTLJIT">more information&lt;/a>. I haven't seen any public benchmark figures. Please do share if you have any.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Eli Bendersky has written an article about &lt;a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2014/05/01/modern-source-to-source-transformation-with-clang-and-libtooling/">how to use libTooling to implement source to source transformations&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The next &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.lldb.devel/3828">Paris LLVM Social&lt;/a> will take place on May 5th (i.e. this evening).&lt;/p>&lt;p>The LLVM Bay Area social &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/36443">will take place on May 8th&lt;/a>. Please RSVP if you are interested.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Discussion is still going on regarding &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72466">last week's proposal to add intrinsics for safe division&lt;/a>. Philip Reames has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72588">shared his reasoning againt the proposal&lt;/a>. This triggered a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of discussion which is unfortunately more than I have time to summarise.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Kevin Modzelewski is working on exceptions for Pyston, the LLVM-based Python JIT and &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72668">asks for advice/experiences on how others have implemented them in projects like VMKit&lt;/a>. There are a number of useful responses.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Alp Toker &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.scm/97880">suggests adding a coding style policy to discourage excessive use of default arguments&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Yi Kong has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72598">suggested improvements to LNT for benchmarking&lt;/a>. One of the concerns raised in followup responses is that benchmark results may not be stable and may take too long to be practical on e.g. ARM hardware. Chris Matthews suggests &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72619">performing a geometric mean similar to the SPEC benchmarks&lt;/a> as an alternative to a plain total execution time metric.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Dario Domizioli has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/36314">posted an RFC for an optnone pragma&lt;/a>. This proposal triggered robust discussion about whether there is any advantage to supporting this in addition to the optnone function attribute, though it seems as though there is enough support for the feature for it to make its way in.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The patch to &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72366">perform common subexpression elimination for a group of getelementptrs&lt;/a> that was discussed a couple of weeks ago has been merged. It is currently only enabled for the NVPTX backend. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207783">r207783&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>X86 code generation has been implemented for the musttail function attribute. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207598">r207598&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Pass run listeners were added to the pass manager. This adds C/C++ APIs to enable fine-grain progress report and safe suspension points. See the commit message for more info &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207430">r207430&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The optimisation remark system has started to be used, with calls to emitOptimizationRemark added to the loop unroller and vectorizer. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207528">r207528&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207574">r207574&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The SLPVectorizer gained the ability to recognize and vectorize intrinsic math functions. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207901">r207901&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>NRVO (named return value optimisation) determination was rewritten. According to the commit message, "a variable now has NRVO applied if and only if every return statement in that scope returns that variable." Also, NRVO is performed roughly 7% more often in a bootstrap clang build. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207890">r207890&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>libclang's documentation comment API has been split in to a separate header. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207392">r207392&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The SLPVectorizer (superword-level parallelism) is now disabled at O0, O1 and Oz. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207433">r207433&lt;/a>. It was later re-enabled at Oz. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207858">r207858&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The libclang API now supports attributes 'pure', 'const', and 'noduplicate'. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207767">r207767&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The comment parser no longer attempts to validate HTML attributes (the previous solution was insufficient). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207712">r207712&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;code>R_MIPS_REL32&lt;/code> relocation are now supported in lld. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207494">r207494&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A collection of CTRL+C related issues were fixed in lldb. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207816">r207816&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #17, Apr 28th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/04/llvm-weekly-17-apr-28th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 07:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/04/llvm-weekly-17-apr-28th-2014.html</guid><description>

Thank you to everyone who wrote in to let me know it is a reference to EGCS. GCC was of course famously forked as EGCS which was later merged back in. Apparently this was pronounced by some as "eggs". Mystery solved.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/17">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>GCC 4.9.0 was &lt;a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2014-04/msg00195.html">released last Tuesday&lt;/a>.

I imagine it will be of interest to many LLVM Weekly readers.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Michael Zolotukhin &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72466">proposes extending LLVM IR with new intrinsics for safe division&lt;/a>. These join the existing intrinsics for addition with overflow. Filip Pizlo follows up with a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72510">description of how it would be used for various potential language frontends&lt;/a>. Michael has also posted a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72533">detailed justification in answer to concerns raised&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>James Molloy &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.cvs/185388/">shares an updated on the AArch64 to ARM64 merge&lt;/a>, including time estimates for remaining tasks. The initial merge should be complete before LLVM 3.5. Additionally, Ana Pazos has gained permission to share &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72454/">relative SPEC2000 figures for ARM64 vs AArch64&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Sylvestre Ledru &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/36229">proposes removing outdated marketing material from the Clang website&lt;/a>. In particular, the performance comparisons are with GCC 4.0 or 4.2 which is of course rather outdated, particularly given how GCC has improved since then.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Kostya Serebryany reports that &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/36234">AddressSanitizer and LeakSanitizer are finding many many leaks within Clang&lt;/a>. The bug tracking this is &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19521">#19521&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Tom Stellard has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72524">kicked off the second testing phase for LLVM and Clang 3.4.1&lt;/a>. This is expected to be the last release candidate, so 3.4.1 shouldn't be far away.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The 'musttail' marker which was &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71775">proposed several weeks ago&lt;/a> has been added. Unlike the 'tail' marker, musttail guarantees that tail call optimization will occur. Check the documentation added in the commit for a more detailed explanation. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207143">r207143&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The rewrite of BlockFrequencyInfo finally landed. A description of the advantages of the new algorithm is in the original commit message, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206548">r206548&lt;/a>. After a series of bounces, it landed in &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206766">r206766&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM can now generate PE/COFF object files targeting 'Windows on ARM'. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207345">r207345&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A CallGraph strongly connected components pass manager has been added making use of the new LazyCallGraph analysis framework. This is part of the new pass manager work Chandler Carruth has been working on and is of course a work in progress. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206745">r206745&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The scheduler model for the Intel Silvermont microarchitecture has been replaced. The commit message claims substantial improvements on integer tests. I'm assuming RAL in this context refers to RegAllocLocal? &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206957">r206957&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>ARM64 has of course seen a large number of changes. Among those, support for feature predicates for NEON/FP/CYPTO instructions. This allows the compiler to generate code without using those instructions. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206949">r206949&lt;/a>. Additionally, there is now a big endian version of the ARM64 target machine. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206965">r206965&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>getFileOffset has been dropped from LLVM's C API. Justification is in the commit message. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206750">r206750&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LoopVectorize pass now keeps statistics on the number of analyzed loops and the number of vectorized loops. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206956">r206956&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The x86 backend gained new intrinsics for Read Time Stamp Counter. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207127">r207127&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Initial work on mutation support for the lazy call graph has landed. As with most of Chandler's commits, there's much more information in the commit message. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206968">r206968&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>MCTargetOptions has been introduced, which for now only contains a single flag. SanitizeAddress enabled AddressSanitizer instrumentation of inline assembly. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206971">r206971&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>llvm-cov now supports gcov's &lt;code>--long-file-names&lt;/code> option. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207035">r207035&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Documentation for sample profiling was added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206994">r206994&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for parsing the linear clause for the 'omp simd' directive was added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206891">r206891&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang gained support for the &lt;code>-fmodules-search-all&lt;/code> option, which searches for symbols in non-imported modules (i.e. those referenced in module maps but not imported). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206977">r206977&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul> &lt;li>&lt;p>AddressSanitizer gained an experimental detector for "one definition rule" violations (where two globals with the same name are defined in different modules). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL207210">r207210&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #16, Apr 21st 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/04/llvm-weekly-16-apr-21st-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2014 05:46:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/04/llvm-weekly-16-apr-21st-2014.html</guid><description>

Mailgun have the useful ability to schedule an email for the future, but when this is done incorrectly have no ability to cancel it via the API. Possibly there is no way for them to cancel it either, I have no way to know as my support ticket on the issue was never answered.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Seeing as it's Easter, does anybody know why GCC has a &lt;a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GNU_Compiler_Collection_logo.svg">GNU breaking out of an egg as a logo&lt;/a>?&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/16">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The new backend to &lt;a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten">Emscripten&lt;/a> which is implemented as an LLVM backend has &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/emscripten-discuss/FACubOKw2TI">now been merged to Emscripten's master branch&lt;/a>. This should result in a noticeable speedup in compile times.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Phoronix have published a &lt;a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;amp;item=gcc49_compiler_llvm35&amp;amp;num=1">small set of benchmarks comparing GCC 4.9RC1 and Clang 3.5 HEAD&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Diego Novillo has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72199">announced AutoFDO&lt;/a>, a tool which will convert profile data generated with &lt;a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org">Linux Perf&lt;/a> to a format compatible with LLVM's sample-based profiler.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The Polly project have &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14d3ehkh3/edit">minutes from another phone call&lt;/a>, this time focusing on delinearization.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Jingyue Wu &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72366">shares an initial patch for common sub-expression elimination (CSE) for getelementptr&lt;/a>. He and his colleagues had found that with the NVPTX backend, loop unrolling often lead to groups of getelementptr instructions which added to register pressure, but that these could often to optimised with some simple CSE. Feedback so far is positive on including something like this is a target-independent pass, though there's interest in seeing whether it helps on any other backends with open source benchmarks.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Austin Seipp has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72374">revived the issue of named register variables&lt;/a>. He adds perspective on the the utility of this feature for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). They are currently suffering a large performance loss on OS X with clang due to the inability to dedicate a register for fast access to thread-local storage. Renato Golin &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72378">followed up&lt;/a> with how he thinks it is best to move forwards on the issue, while Mark Seaborn &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72375">shared a neat trick the NaCl team use&lt;/a> where they inline &lt;code>pthread_getspecific&lt;/code> after verifying it contains the code they expect.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Kostya Serebryany &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72247">shares his concerns about contention between threads on access to profile counters&lt;/a>. For a multi-threaded VP9 encoder, he's seeing 7x overhead when running with &lt;code>-fprofile-instr-generate&lt;/code> vs 15% when single-threaded. There's too much for me to summarise, but there's a lot of discussion on potential solutions which the interested reader should certainly take a look at.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Dan Gohman answers a question about LLVM IR access to struct fields with a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72331">concise summary of how alias analysis information is currently used in LLVM&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Richard Carback is &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72201">seeking feedback on his TableGen DAGISel documentation&lt;/a>. His &lt;a href="https://github.com/draperlaboratory/fracture/wiki/How-TableGen%27s-DAGISel-Backend-Works">notes&lt;/a> seem like a great start at documenting what has been up till now one of the more mysterious parts of LLVM. Particularly those who have experience with this code are encouraged to check the document for accuracy.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM's internal BumpPtrAllocator has been switched to using a vector of pointers to slabs rather than a single linked list and the underlying allocator is now a template parameter. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206147">r206147&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206149">r206149&lt;/a>. The allocator can now also pass the size to the deallocation function, which improves performance with some libraries (e.g. tcmalloc). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL20265">r206265&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for building persistent strongly connected components has been added to the LazyCallGraph. There are detailed comments on the reasoning of this approach and some details on implementation in the commit message. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206581">r206581&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Constant hoisting has been enabled on PowerPC. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206141">r206141&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>PseudoSourceValue is no longer a subclass of Value. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206255">r206255&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A DebugInfoVerifier has been implemented. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206300">r206300&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>MIPS gained initial support for the IEEE 754-2008 NaN encoding. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202812">r206396&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>OnDiskHashTable has been moved from Clang to LLVM. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206438">r206438&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>ARM's IR-based atomics pass has been moved from Target to CodeGen, which allows it to be used by ARM64. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206485">r206485&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206490">r206490&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Module verification is now off by default in release builds for the JIT, but this can be overridden. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206561">r206561&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The Cortex-A53 machine model description has been ported from AArch64 to ARM64. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206652">r206652&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>There is now a new hash algorithm for calculating the function hash for instruction profiling, rewritten to help ensure the hash changes when control flow does. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206397">r206397&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The thread safety analysis SSA pass has been rewritten. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206338">r206338&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for big endian ARM64 was added to Targets.cpp. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206390">r206390&lt;/a>.

The bad news is their initial plan did not survive contact with the enemy, though they're hard at work on fixing it and a new update can be expected in good time.&lt;/p>&lt;p>As &lt;a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=MTY2MjY">reported by Phoronix&lt;/a>, a number of patches towards the goal of compiling the Linux kernel with clang have been &lt;a href="http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=09c9b61d5da24174b867a6ffda29b7435e1fda74">merged&lt;/a> by Linus.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The first release candidate of GCC 4.9 has been &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gcc.devel/135468">released&lt;/a>. New features in the 4.9 branch are &lt;a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.9/changes.html">documented here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Polly had a meeting via phone call, and &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12W-qZjiZGEQ_lVrob4OzvKJI3EooonC-ap1b9f9KCUE/edit">notes of that meeting are available&lt;/a>. The part of most general interest is probably discussion around the potential of merging Polly into the LLVM mainline.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM 3.4.1 has now &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72127">entered the testing phase&lt;/a> and help testing the release would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Tim Northover has [summarised the discussion about merging AArch64 and ARM64 from EuroLLVM]. The view is still in favour of merging from AArch64 to ARM64. Interestingly, &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71996">apparently&lt;/a> Google are working on a framework to build and run benchmarks (something different to &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/lnt/">LNT&lt;/a> I guess). Also of interest are [benchmarks of ARM64 LLVM vs AArch64 LLVM vs GCC 4.9] on Cortex-A53. There's now a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72133">somewhat detailed plan for the merge&lt;/a> and remaining tasks.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Alon Zakai has shared &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71989">some details on his work on a C backend for Emscripten&lt;/a>. Right now he describes it as a 'quick hack', though current performance seems quite good with only a 19% slowdown on zlib. The current version of the code is in emscripten's &lt;a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/tree/c_backend">&lt;code>c_backend&lt;/code> branch&lt;/a> (in &lt;code>tools/c_backend.py&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>David Blaikie started a discussion about &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/36014">debug info for captured variables in a C++11 lambda&lt;/a>. There's too much here for me to comfortably summarise, but do dig in if you're interested.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Jim Grosbach suggests &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71992">low-level tools like llc should not do CPU auto-detection&lt;/a>. There's general agreement that this is a good idea and will help to avoid the problem of tests failing on one machine but not another due to this auto-detection. The change has now been merged.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Jonas Wagner &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72036">shared his workflow using a gold linker plugin to link LLVM bitcode&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Will Dietz &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72019">responded&lt;/a> to a query about unexpected code generation with a great analysis of what may be going on.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Robert Matusewicz is &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/72083">looking for interest in keeping the poolalloc project alive&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The NVPTX backend gained preliminary intrinsics and codegen support for textures and surfaces. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205907">r205907&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for optimisation report diagnostics was added. This starts to implement the idea &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FYUatSjZZO-zmFBxjOiuOzAy9mhHA8hqdvklZv68WuQ/edit#heading=h.qk42du84eyjg">documented and discussed previously&lt;/a>. In the future it will be possible to get a report of the major optimization decisions taken by compiler transformations. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205774">r205774&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205775">r205775&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The merge of AArch64 and ARM4 continues. Named immediate operand mapping logic and enums have been copied from AArch64 to ARM64. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205866">r205866&lt;/a>. The ARM64 backend has seen a large series of smaller commits as well.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Constant hoisting is now enabled for the ARM64 backend. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205791">r205791&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Previously, optimisation logic in CodeGenPrepare that tried to merge address computation in to the memory operation itself (when supported by the platform's addressing modes) would do so by adding integer operations and using ptrtoint and inttoptr. This caused issues when trying to use alias analysis during CodeGen. There is now opt-in support for doing this using GetElementPtr. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL206092">r206092&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The debug info compression support introduced two weeks ago was reverted, and replaced with a new implementation that compresses the whole section rather than a fragment. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205989">r205989&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205990">r205990&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The segmented stack switch has been moved to a function attribute and the old &lt;code>-segmented-stacks&lt;/code> command line flag removed. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205997">r205997&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A major refactoring of the thread safety analysis has been started. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205728">r205728&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205745">r205745&lt;/a>, and more.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>libclang gained a &lt;code>clang_CXXMethod_isConst&lt;/code> method. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205714">r205714&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>As part of the ongoing project to support the MSVC++ ABI, support for &lt;code>#pragma section&lt;/code> and related programs was added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205810">r205810&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>New command line options were added to support big or little endian for ARM and AArch64. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205966">r205966&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205907">r205967&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>The openmp project gained the offload directory, which contains code needed to support OpenMP 4.0 target directives. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205909">r205909&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #14, Apr 7th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/04/llvm-weekly-14-apr-7th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2014 06:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/04/llvm-weekly-14-apr-7th-2014.html</guid><description>

Abstract is &lt;a href="http://pastebin.com/StSzTzMv">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>EuroLLVM is of course taking place on Monday and Tuesday of this week. Sadly I won't be in attendance. If anyone is blogging the event, please do send me links.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/14">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The LLVM-related news that has made the biggest splash this week is surely the &lt;a href="https://tech.dropbox.com/2014/04/introducing-pyston-an-upcoming-jit-based-python-implementation/">announcement of Pyston, a JIT for Python targeting LLVM&lt;/a>. More technical details are &lt;a href="https://github.com/dropbox/pyston#technical-features">available on the Github repo&lt;/a>. For many this immediately conjures up memories of the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/">Unladen Swallow project&lt;/a>, started by Google engineers with the same aim of JITting Python with LLVM. That project was eventually unsuccessful, but it's unfair to the authors of Pyston to assume it will have the same fate. It's unclear how much developer time Dropbox are contributing to Pyston. They clearly have a lot of work to do, though it's no secret that &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2013-October/066573.html">Apple are also looking to target LLVM from JavaScript&lt;/a> which means they're not the only developers working in this area. Kevin Modzelewski &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71870">shared some more info&lt;/a> on the LLVM mailing list which details some of the LLVM work they've implemented so far (including some initial escape analysis for GCed memory).&lt;/p>&lt;p>An independent, non-profit LLVM Foundation &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2014/04/the-llvm-foundation.html">is to be formed&lt;/a>. As a vendor neutral organisation it will represent the community interest and aims to be set up by the end of the year.The initial board of directors will be Vikram Adve, Chandler Carruth, Doug Gregor, David Kipping, Anton Korobeynikov, Chris Lattner, Tanya Lattner, and Alex Rosenberg.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Rust 0.10 &lt;a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2014-April/009387.html">has been released&lt;/a>. See also the discussion on &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7524945">Hacker News&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/224gh3/rust_010_released/">Reddit&lt;/a>. Rust is a systems programming language from Mozilla which uses LLVM as its code generator backend.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://dagger.repzret.org/">Dagger&lt;/a> LLVM-based decompilation framework has &lt;a href="http://dagger.repzret.org/update-a-sneak-peek-of-the-source/">released its source&lt;/a> as well as publishing a series of five articles documenting its implementation approach and documenting the next steps or 'TODOs'.&lt;/p>&lt;p>An &lt;a href="https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate-llvm">LLVM backend for the Accelerate Array Language&lt;/a> has been released. It compiles Accelerate code to LLVM IR and can target multicore CPUs as well as NVIDIA GPUs.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://github.com/gannimo/MalDiv/raw/master/paper/talk_payerm_syscan14.pdf">PDF slides&lt;/a>for a recent talk about the LLVM-based &lt;a href="https://github.com/gannimo/MalDiv">MalDiv&lt;/a> diversifying compiler have been published. Such a tool effectively defeats signature-based matching of malware.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>James Molloy from ARM has been looking at the recently open sourced ARM64 backend from Apple, and has come to the conclusion that &lt;a href="article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71737">it's easier to use ARM64 as a base an merge in from AArch64&lt;/a>. The key justification is that ARM64 backend is more performant but has some correctness issues, and porting performance fixes is more difficult than correctness. There seems to be agreement from the followup responses. Bradley Smith reports &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71861">good progress on fixing observed correctness issues and some interesting performance results&lt;/a>. Of interest to those attending EuroLLVM this week, there will be discussions on Monday and after the main conference on Wednesday (details &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71947">here&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Requests for patches to be included in LLVM/Clang 3.4.1 have started to come in. These include &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71788">a large number of AArch64 patches&lt;/a> (plus &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71849">another&lt;/a>), plus some &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71809">assorted bugfixes&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Reid Kleckner has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71775">proposed a new tail call marker&lt;/a>, 'musttail' which guarantees that tail call optimization will occur.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Shankar Easwaran starts a discussion on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71852">adding support to lld for demangling symbols&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Jeroen Dobbelaere has an &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71881">interesting problem&lt;/a> with an architecture he is targeting. The architecture has 64-bit registers, but the pointer size is always 32-bits. JF Bastien suggests &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71923">this is similar to PNaCl and the x32 ABI&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Peter Collingbourne &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71773">proposes an IR extension for loads/stores with deterministic trap/unwind behaviour&lt;/a>. The aim is to support zero cost exception handling for operations that may trap. The proposal comes with initial patches, though Andrew Trick &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71934">questions whether adding new IR instructions is the right approach&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LLVM project Phabricator instance has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/35992">been moved to reviews.llvm.org&lt;/a>. Currently links to the old one are broken, but hopefully a redirect will be set up. By the time you read this I should have updated all broken links from llvmweekly.org.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>MipsAsmParser and MipsOperand was rewritten. The improvements are documented in the commit message. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205292">r205292&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The ARM backend gained support for segmented stacks. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205430">r205430&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Windows on ARM support is now possible with the MachineCode layer. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205459">r205459&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>TargetLowering gained a hook to control when &lt;code>BUILD_VECTOR&lt;/code> might be expanded using shuffles. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205230">r205230&lt;/a>. Targets might choose to use ExpandBVWithShuffles which was added in a later commit. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205243">r205243&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>X86TargetTransformInfo gained getUnrollingPreferences, which is used by the generic loop unroller. This helps to optimise use of the micro-op caches on X86. This produced 7.5%-15% speedups in the TSVC benchmark suite. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205348">r205348&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>ARM gained a nice little optimisation pass that removes duplicated DMB instructions. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205409">r205409&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Atomic ldrex/strex loops are now expanded in IR rather than at MachineInstr emission time. This cleans up code, but should also make future optimisations easier. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205525">r205525&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The clang static analyzer gained double-unlock detection in PthreadLockChecker, as well as a check for using locks after they are destroyed. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205274">r205274&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205275">r205275&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The OpenMP 'copyin' clause was implemented. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205164">r205164&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The 'optnone' attribute was added, which suppresses most optimisations on a function. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205255">r205255&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The heuristics for choosing methods to suggest as corrections were improved, to ignore methods that obviously won't work. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205653">r205653&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The 'BitwiseConstraintManager' idea was added to the open projects page. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205666">r205666&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>AddressSanitizer can now be used as a shared library on Linux. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205308">r205308&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>compiler-rt gained support for IEEE754 quad precision comparison functions. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205312">r205312&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>lld now supports &lt;code>.gnu.linkonce&lt;/code> sections. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL205280">r205280&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>The LLVM Foundation</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/04/the-llvm-foundation.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2014 09:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/04/the-llvm-foundation.html</guid><description>
&lt;br />&lt;div>The LLVM umbrella project has grown over the years into a vibrant community made up of many sub-projects, with hundreds of contributors. &amp;nbsp;The results of this project are used by millions of people every day. &amp;nbsp;Today, I'm happy to announce that we are taking the next big step, and forming a new, independent non-profit to represent the community interest. &amp;nbsp;"The LLVM Foundation" will allow us to:&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&amp;nbsp;- Solve infrastructure problems.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&amp;nbsp;- Address financial challenges around the developer meetings and infrastructure expenses.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&amp;nbsp;- Deliver improved transparency into operational and policy matters&lt;/div>&lt;div>&amp;nbsp;- Provide a company-neutral organization to help ensure success well into the future.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>We are working towards a goal of having this organization functioning by the end of the year, possibly sooner.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>In terms of structure, we expect the foundation to be lean: an oversight board of volunteers and a dedicated administrator. &amp;nbsp;The expectations of this administrator will be to oversee long-overdue upgrades to our infrastructure (such as the web site design, bug database, mailing lists, etc), organize the US LLVM Developer Meeting, and drive the formation of the foundation itself. &amp;nbsp;We do not expect significant change to our developer policies (i.e. licensing &amp;amp; copyright). &amp;nbsp;Our system of domain-expert "code owners" will continue to drive the technical direction of their areas. &amp;nbsp;As an LLVM contributor, the biggest changes that you can expect to see are things operating more smoothly and infrastructure issues getting the attention they deserve.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Tanya Lattner has been spearheading the formation of the Foundation and has graciously agreed to take on the administrator role. &amp;nbsp;Tanya has been actively involved in LLVM since 2003. &amp;nbsp;Many of you know Tanya from her LLVM community involvement such as organizing the US LLVM Developer Meetings and management of the website and other infrastructure. &amp;nbsp;She implemented Swing Modulo Scheduling in LLVM for her Masters thesis at UIUC, served as the release manager from LLVM 1.7 through 2.7, and in a commercial setting she implemented LLVM based optimization tools and contributed to an LLVM-based OpenCL implementation.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>We have also been quietly speaking with members of the community, working to select a diverse board of directors, that accurately reflects the community’s interests. &amp;nbsp;We looked to active members of the community, representing both academic and commercial interests, people from organizations that contribute to the developer meeting and testing infrastructure, and technical leads from some of the prominent LLVM sub-projects. &amp;nbsp;We sought diversity in the board, while trying to keep it small enough to be nimble. &amp;nbsp;The initial board of directors will be:&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>Vikram Adve&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>Chandler Carruth&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>Doug Gregor&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>David Kipping&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>Anton Korobeynikov&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>Chris Lattner&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>Tanya Lattner&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>Alex Rosenberg&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>I expect that there will be many questions and comments. &amp;nbsp;The foundation is intended to represent the interests of the community, so please send questions to the &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev">LLVMdev mailing list&lt;/a>. &amp;nbsp;More information will be coming over the next few months as things progress.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>-Chris&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #13, Mar 31st 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/03/llvm-weekly-13-mar-31st-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2014 07:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/03/llvm-weekly-13-mar-31st-2014.html</guid><description>

Also, keep your eyes on the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/X-Dev-London/">X-Dev London meetup page&lt;/a> as I'm expecting to give an LLVM-related talk there on the 9th April, though it's not listed yet and is subject to change.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/13">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>It's only a week to go until &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-04/">EuroLLVM 2014&lt;/a>, which wil be held in Edinburgh on the 7th and 8th of April. Tragically I'm not going to be there as I'm trying to focus on getting my PhD finished, but the schedule looks fantastic.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The Linux Collaboration Summit featured an update on progress of the LLVMLinux project to build the Linux kernel using LLVM/Clang (&lt;a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/2014-Collab-LLVMLinux.pdf">slides&lt;/a>).

It claims to benchmark much faster than GCC's preprocessor resulting in faster build times, though a &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7489532">quick comparison with Clang&lt;/a> didn't show it in a favourable light speed-wise.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Meeting C++ have published a helpful summary of &lt;a href="http://meetingcpp.com/index.php/br/items/cpp-status.html">what might make its way in to C++17 or C++1y&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Apple are &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71638">contributing their 64-bit ARM backend upstream&lt;/a>. Initially, this will co-exist with the current AArch64 backend (the Apple implementation is called ARM64), and over time the backends will be merged.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Tom Stellard has [announced a tentative release schedule for LLVM and Clang 3.4.1] and is searching for volunteers to test, as well as nominations for patches that should be included.

April 9 - April 18: Testing Phase April 18: 3.4.1 Release&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Frank Winter started a discussion on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71487">how to specify the alignment of a pointer in LLVM IR&lt;/a>, which yields some interesting responses.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Renato Golin kicked off a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71567">discussion about supporting named registers in LLVM/Clang&lt;/a>. This is a GNU extension not currently supported. There seemed to be some agreement that this is worth supporting, which resulted in a follow-on thread on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71625">how to implement support for named registers&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/35858">query from Geoffrey Irving&lt;/a> about how to safely make use of floating point rounding mode resulted in an interesting discussion about how a changing rounding modes could be supported.

Previously he &lt;a href="http://www.philipreames.com/Blog/2014/02/21/why-not-use-gcroot/">described the issues of using the llvm.gcroot intrinsic&lt;/a>. True to his word, he's followed up that post with a description of '&lt;a href="http://www.philipreames.com/Blog/2014/03/18/late-safepoint-placement-overview/">late safepoint placement&lt;/a>', which is the approach Philip and his colleagues are working on to address the problem. More updates are promised over the next few weeks.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>musl libc 1.0.0 &lt;a href="http://www.musl-libc.org/download.html">has been released&lt;/a>. It is an MIT-licensed libc aiming to compete with glibc. "musl is a new general-purpose implementation of the C library. It is lightweight, fast, simple, free, and aims to be correct in the sense of standards-conformance and safety."&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://erllvm.softlab.ntua.gr/">LLVM backend for the HiPE Erlang compiler&lt;/a> has been &lt;a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/9d46875b53ffb21bc55aec4a2c76472133ea5d1c">merged&lt;/a> in to the Erlang/OTP master branch.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The 'Mystical Programming blog' has an amusing article on &lt;a href="http://mysticalprogramming.wordpress.com/2014/03/19/how-to-abuse-a-cpp-compiler/">non-terminating C++ template computations&lt;/a> along with information on how GCC and Clang handle each example.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Meeting C++ have written up a &lt;a href="http://meetingcpp.com/index.php/br/items/looking-at-c14.html">list of things likely to make their way in to C++14&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.ceemple.com/what-is-ceemple/">Ceemple&lt;/a>, an LLVM-based product for technical computing, has been released. It's marketed as offering a number of advantages over Python or MATLAB in this space.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The next Cambridge LLVM Social will &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71338">take place on the 26th March, 7.30pm&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>David Given is working on an architecture that uses integer registers to store floating point values, and &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71368">asks for advice&lt;/a> on how to represent this in tablegen without being stopped dead by "cannot infer all types in pattern" errors.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Renato Golin has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71340">kicked off another thread on unwinding and exception handling and function attributes&lt;/a>. He's done a fantastic job of summarising the issues and proposal on moving forward which means I don't have to feel lazy by suggesting you just go read the thread if you're interested.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Arch Robinson asks the list for &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71307">advice on improving the SLPVectorizer in order to help with Julia code he's looking at&lt;/a>. The &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71308">response&lt;/a> from Arnold Schwaighofer is worth a read for anyone interested in hacking in this area.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Discussion about a binary format for instrumentation-based profiling data has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71306">continued&lt;/a>, with the suggestion that the format written out by instrumentation need not be the same as the format read back by the compiler (it could be transformed by other tools). Justin Bogner has detailed &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71434">proposed requirements&lt;/a> for these formats.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Tim Hill started an interesting discussion by &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/35755">sharing his experiences from switching to Clang&lt;/a>. Among the positives were excellent errors, the static analyzer, compatibility, and quality of generated code. The main negative is the lack of documentation for many compiler options. There's general agreement in the responses that this is a problem that should be fixed in the (hopefully not too distant) future.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Lang Hames has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71352">proposed an RFC on adding an empty method to &lt;code>iterator_range&lt;/code>&lt;/a>.

It's therefore official, I am a compiler. Presumably this makes me uniquely suited to writing LLVM Weekly.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Previously I've only linked to internship opportunities rather than job ads. I'd be interested in how readers feel about linking to job ads looking for someone with LLVM experience? Do let me know via email or Twitter.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/11">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM's popular &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/">'Kaleidoscope' tutorial&lt;/a> on implementing a language with LLVM has been &lt;a href="https://github.com/hobinjk/rusty-kaleidoscope">ported to Rust&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-04/#callfor">programme for EuroLLVM 2014&lt;/a> has been announced. EuroLLVM will be taking place in Edinburgh, Scotland on the 7th and 8th of April. At the time of writing, there are still some spaces available.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The PNaCl 'canary' toolchain is &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/native-client-discuss/qkahSDf5lrM">now based on LLVM 3.4&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/">Intel intrinsics guide&lt;/a> is a useful reference for the massive variety of specialised functionality available on modern Intel CPUs.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Broadcom Cambridge are &lt;a href="http://jobs.broadcom.com/job/Cambridge-Engineer%2C-Principal-LLVM-Compiler-Engineer/30894500/">looking for an LLVM compiler engineer&lt;/a>.

Currently the section attribute can be used on GlobalVariables and Functions, but as pointed out in the RFC this has issues. Another key motivator is to support the representation of the Microsoft ABI's RTTI (runtime type information) data.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Justin Bogner has posted two profiling-related RFCs. The first is related to &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71179">creating a LLVM library for reading and writing profile data&lt;/a>. He also proposes a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71190">binary format for instrumentation-based profiling data&lt;/a> as opposed to the naive textual format currently used. A library to work with a proposed binary profile data format was actually &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL203703">commited this week&lt;/a>, but the commit was reverted in order for more discussion to take place.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Mike McFadden's &lt;a href="https://github.com/BonzaiThePenguin/WikiSort">detailed write-up of his implementation of an in-place merge sort&lt;/a> has been making the rounds on Reddit and Hacker News this week. He &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/35668">posted to the clang mailing list&lt;/a> to ask whether there's someone in particular to speak to about using his implementation to replace libcxx's current &lt;code>inplace_stable_sort&lt;/code> (which his implementation beats by 3-15x). No responses to his &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.scm/94723">post to cfe-commits&lt;/a> yet.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Mikael Persson has announced to the mailing list that &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/35656">he has been continuing work on the Templight debugger&lt;/a>, and attaches a revised version of the Templight patch. &lt;a href="http://plc.inf.elte.hu/templight/">Templight&lt;/a> is a debugger and profiler for C++ template meta-programming. The main addition to the previous official release is that Mikael has added a gdb-style debugger.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Rudolphe Suescun's question about &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71138">whether lld is ready for his project&lt;/a> prompted some interesting replies detailing current status and gaps in the LLVM linker, lld. In particular, the current lack of support for linker scripts and lack of support for merge debug info when linking.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>I don't believe I made mention of this last week, but it's been decided that virtual methods that override their base class should be marked with the &lt;code>override&lt;/code> keyword (and that the &lt;code>virtual&lt;/code> keyword would then be considered redundant). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL203433">r203433&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL203442">r203442&lt;/a>, and others.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for NaCl support on MIPS developed, with the addition of sandboxing for loads, stores, stack pointer changes, and function calls. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL203484">r203484&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL203606">r203606&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>As discussed in an &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71039">RFC last week&lt;/a>, cmpxchg now has a second ordering operand which describes the required semantics in case no exchange takes place. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL203559">r203559&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>An optimisation was added so that switch-to-lookup-table conversion can be done by adding a bitmask check.

There's some good stuff in the comments too.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Version 2.1 of the Capstone disassembly framework has &lt;a href="http://www.capstone-engine.org/Version-2.1.html">been released&lt;/a>. Library size is about 40% smaller, memory usage is down 40% and there are performance improvements as well.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Facebook have released &lt;a href="https://github.com/facebook/chisel">Chisel&lt;/a>, a collection of LLDB commands to assist debugging iOS apps.&lt;/p>&lt;p>A &lt;a href="https://github.com/gilligan/vim-lldb">fork of vim-lldb&lt;/a>, the LLDB plugin for Vim included in the lldb repo has appeared. Changes so far have been relatively minor.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Probably one of the most interesting discussions on the mailing list this week came from Mark Seaborn's &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70908">questions about upstreaming PNaCl's IR simplification passes&lt;/a>. Both PNaCl and the new Emscripten fastcomp backend make use of a series of out-of-tree IR-to-IR passes that simplify the IR by lowering complex to simpler features. The suggestion is to upstream these so that everyone can benefit. Chandler Carruth &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70918">raises concerns&lt;/a> that these passes might bitrot without any in-tree users, suggesting that the PNaCl and Emscripten communities could do more to contribute to upstream LLVM and that such a track record would help ease that concern. There are a number of people chiming in to say they would find the functionality useful.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Diego Novillo asks &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70998">whether people would be interested in an optimization report facility&lt;/a>. This would give useful information about the decisions taken by various optimisers, which might be useful when investigating why code doesn't perform as expected and in finding missed optimisations. Unsurprisingly, everyone thinks this would be a good feature. Diego promises to write some more detailed, concrete proposals in the coming days now it's clear people like the general idea.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Kev Kitchens &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70896">asks about cross-compiling compiler-rt&lt;/a>. Vadim Chugunov helpfully points to &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70902">his work on Rust's fork of compiler-rt&lt;/a> to support this. It's also pointed out in the thread that support for unwinding actually lives in libc++abi rather than in a separate libunwind where you might expect to find it.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>There's a pretty &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/35446">long discussion on naming for reverse iterators and other issues&lt;/a> which should make entertaining reading for anyone who enjoys bikeshedding (not that there's anything wrong with it, there's some good discussion of API naming principles there).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Tim Northover has shared an RFC (with initial patch) on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/71039">adding a second ordering operand to cmpxchg&lt;/a> which which indicates the failure ordering.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new implementation of PBQP (partitioned boolean quadratic programming)-based register allocator landed. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202735">r202735&lt;/a>. The original commit (&lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202551">r202551&lt;/a>) message details the changes, including massively reduced memory consumption. Average memory reduction is claimed to be 400x. The tagline is "PBQP: No longer feasting upon every last byte of your RAM".&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>AArch64 gained a machine description for Cortex-A53, which involved giving all non-NEON instructions scheduling annotations. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL203125">r203125&lt;/a>. REVERTED&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The SPARC backend gained support for the VIS SIMD instruction set extensions. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202660">r202660&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A whole bunch of classes moved around, with the intention that LLVM's support library will work when building with C++ modules. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202814">r202814&lt;/a> and many others. InstIterator, GetElementPtrTypeIterator, CallSite, PatternMatch, ValueHandle, ValueMap, CFG, ConstantFolder, NoFolder, PredIteratorCache, ConstantRange, PassNameParser, and LeakDetector moved from Support to IR.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;code>PROLOG_LABEL&lt;/code> TargetOpcode was replaced with &lt;code>CFI_INSTRUCTION&lt;/code> which is intended to have simpler semantics and be less convoluted to use. See the commit message for more details. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL203024">r203204&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Uses of &lt;code>OwningPtr&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code> were replaced with &lt;code>std::unique_ptr&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL203083">r203083&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;code>inalloca&lt;/code> grammar was cleaned up. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL203376">r203376&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The PGO (profile-guided optimisation) code got some minor refactoring in preparation for handling non-C/C++ code, and initial suport for Objective-C blocks. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL203073">r203073&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL203157">r203157&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Module dependences are now included in the dependency files created by &lt;code>-MD/-MMD&lt;/code> etc. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL203208">r203208&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;code>-Wunreachable-code&lt;/code> option no longer warns about dead code guarded by a configuration value. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202912">r202912&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The MSVC mangling scheme is not used for statics or types which aren't visible. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202951">r202951&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLDB now supported JIT debugging on Linux using the GDB JIT interface. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202956">r202956&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Polly started emitting llvm.loop metadata for parallel loops. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202854">r202854&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>In compiler-rt, assembler implementations of &lt;code>__sync_fetch_and_*&lt;/code> for ARM were committed. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202812">r202812&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The level of windows support in LLD has been documented. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL203017">r203017&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #9, Mar 3rd 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/03/llvm-weekly-9-mar-3rd-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 05:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/03/llvm-weekly-9-mar-3rd-2014.html</guid><description>

Hopefully it should be available soon in DRM-free digital formats on oreilly.com. I will be putting more of my Raspberry Pi exploits and tutorials on &lt;a href="http://muxup.com">muxup.com&lt;/a>, so if that interests you follow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/muxup">@muxup&lt;/a>.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/9">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The list of &lt;a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/list/public/google/gsoc2014">mentoring organisations for Google Summer of Code 2014&lt;/a> has been released. LLVM is one of them, so any budding compiler engineers who qualify may want to check out the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/OpenProjects.html">ideas page&lt;/a>. Other organisations I spotted advertising relevant project ideas are &lt;a href="http://llvm.linuxfoundation.org/index.php/GSoC">the Linux Foundation&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/SummerOfCodeIdeas/">X.org&lt;/a> and of course &lt;a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SummerOfCode">GCC&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>At the end of last week, Broadcom made a major step forward in &lt;a href="http://blog.broadcom.com/chip-design/android-for-all-broadcom-gives-developers-keys-to-the-videocore-kingdom/">announcing the release of full register level documentation for the VideoCore IV graphics engine&lt;/a> as well as full graphics driver source. The device most well-known for featuring VideoCore IV is the &lt;a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/6299">Raspberry Pi&lt;/a>. The released documentation opens the door to producing something similar to the &lt;a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/5934">GPU-accelerated FFT library&lt;/a> support that was recently released. Some readers of LLVM Weekly may of course be interested in using this information to produce an LLVM backend. Hopefully the following pointers will help. There are lots of resources linked to at the homepage of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/hermanhermitage/videocoreiv">VideoCore IV reverse engineering project&lt;/a>. I'd draw particular attention to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/hermanhermitage/videocoreiv-qpu">QPU reverse engineering effort&lt;/a> which contains good information despite the reverse engineering part of the work being made unnecessary by the Broadcom release. You may want to check out the &lt;a href="http://www.freelists.org/archive/raspi-internals/">raspi-internals mailing list&lt;/a> and &lt;code>#raspberrypi-internals&lt;/code> on Freenode. It's also worth looking at &lt;a href="https://github.com/hermanhermitage/videocoreiv-qpu/tree/master/qpu-fft">the commented disassembly of the VideoCore FFT code&lt;/a> and Herman Hermitage's work in progress &lt;a href="https://github.com/hermanhermitage/videocoreiv-qpu/tree/master/qpu-tutorial">QPU tutorial&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Code for &lt;a href="https://github.com/draperlaboratory/fracture">Fracture&lt;/a>, an architecture-independent decompiler to LLVM IR has been released.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Olivier Goffart has written about &lt;a href="http://woboq.com/blog/moc-with-clang.html">his proof of concept reimplementation of Qt's moc using libclang&lt;/a>. It's actually from last year, but it's new to me.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Alex Denisov has written a &lt;a href="http://railsware.com/blog/2014/02/28/creation-and-using-clang-plugin-with-xcode/">guide to writing a clang plugin&lt;/a>. He gives an example of a minimal plugin that complains about lowercased Objective C class names.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Coursera are re-running &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compilers">their compilers course&lt;/a> on March the 17th. See &lt;a href="http://dirkjan.ochtman.nl/writing/2012/07/21/compilers-on-coursera.html">Dirkjan Ochtman's impressions of the course from the previous run&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The Qualcomm LLVM team are &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70655">advertising for an intern&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Denis Steckelmacher &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70671">kicked off a discussion about the suggested GSoC project to use LLVM for code generation&lt;/a>. There are particularly interesting replies from &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.valgrind.devel/26122">Kirill Batuzov&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.valgrind.devel/26124">Julian Seward&lt;/a> who elaborate on why it's not a case of 'just use LLVM and it will be fast' as well as suggesting some changes that could be made to increase Valgrind's speed.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Chandler Carruth &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70836">announces he has flipped the switch for C++11 support on the build systems&lt;/a>. I, for one, welcome our new C++11 overloards.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>For those interested in the issues of supporting precise GC on LLVM, see the discussion surrounding Philip Reames' &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70724">question on representing a safepoint&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Alp Toker &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70714">proposed a way to move forward with the LLVM OpenMP runtime&lt;/a>. The main issue right now is there is no real test suite. Alp's suggestion is to organise a few days effort to adapt the libgomp test suite (to be hosted externally, due to licensing reasons).&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Jasper Neumann &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70789">suggested a cunning optimisation&lt;/a> for checking the modulus. Benjamin Kramer explains the difficulty of integrating such an optimisation in to the peephole optimiser.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Nico Weber &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/35267">suggests a Clang warning that fires on unexpected indentation levels&lt;/a>. He has &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=18938">prototype implementation&lt;/a> up on the bugtracker.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Saleem Abdulrasool has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/35268">suggested adding a macro that indicates the LLVM integrated assembler is being used&lt;/a>. Respondents to the thread so far aren't keen on the idea, pointing out that projects should really check whether a certain syntax or feature they need works rather than marking themselves incompatible with the LLVM integrated assembler which may of course improve compatibility in the future.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLVM grew a big-endian AArch64 target &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202024">r202024&lt;/a>. Some might consider it a step back, but apparently there's a decent number of people interested in big-endian on AArch64. There's an interesting &lt;a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/wiki/images/c/c4/Kvm-forum-2013-crossing-the-endianness-bridge.pdf">presentation from ARM&lt;/a> about running a virtualised BE guest on a LE host.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The flipping of the C++11 switch has allowed a number of simplifications to start to make their way in to the LLVM codebase. For instance, turning simple functors in to lambdas. Like or loathe C++11 lambda syntax, they're certainly less verbose. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202588">r202588&lt;/a>. &lt;code>OwningPtr&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code> gained support for being converted to and from &lt;code>std::unique_ptr&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code>, which lays the ground for LLVM moving to using &lt;code>std::unique_ptr&lt;/code> in the future. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202609">r202609&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The coding standards document was updated to reflect the C++11 features that can now be used in the LLVM/Clang codebase and to provide guidance on their use. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202497">r202497&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202620">r202620&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The loop vectorizer is now included in the LTO optimisation pipeline by default. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202051">r202051&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>DataLayout has been converted to be a plain object rather than a pass. A DataLayoutPass which holds a DataLayout has been introduced. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202168">r202168&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The PowerPC backend learned to track condition register bits, which produced measurable speedups (10-35%) for the POWER7 benchmark suite. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202451">r202451&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>X86 SSE-related instructions gained a scheduling model. Sadly there is no indication whether this makes any measurable difference to common benchmarks. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202065">r202065&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The scalar replacement of aggregates pass (SROA) got a number of refactorings and bug fixes from Chandler Carruth, including some bug fixes for handling pointers from address spaces other than the default. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202092">r202092&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202247">r202247&lt;/a>, and more.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>An experimental implementation of an invalid-pointer-pair detector was added as part of AddressSanitizer. This attempts to identify when two unrelated pointers are compared or subtracted. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202389">r202389&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Shed a tear, for libtool has been removed from the LLVM build system. The commit says it was only being used to find the shared library extension and nm. The diffstat of 93 insertions and 35277 deletions speaks for itself. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202524">r202524&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The initial changes needed for &lt;code>omp simd&lt;/code> directive support were landed. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202360">r202360&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;code>-Wabsolute-value&lt;/code> warning was committed, which will warn for several cases of misuse of absolute value functions. It will warn when using e.g. an int absolute value function on a float, or when using it one a type of the wrong size (e.g. using abs rather than llabs on a long long), or whn taking the absolute value of an unsigned value. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202211">r202211&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>An API was added to libclang to create a buffer with a JSON virtual file overlay description. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202105">r202105&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The driver option &lt;code>-ivfsoverlay&lt;/code> was added, which reads the description of a virtual filesystem from a file and overlays it over the real file system. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202176">r202176&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>CFG edges have been reworked to encode potentially unreachable edges. This involved adding the AdjacentBlock class this encodes whether the block is reachable or not. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202325">r202325&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The 'remark' diagnostic type was added. This provides additional information to the user (e.g. information from the vectorizer about loops that have been vectorized). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202475">r202475&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The compiler-rt subproject now has a &lt;code>CODE_OWNERS.txt&lt;/code> to indicate who is primarily responsible for each part of the project. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202377">r202377&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A standalone deadlock detector was added to ThreadSanitizer. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202505">r202505&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The OpenMP runtime has been ported to FreeBSD. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL202478">r202478&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #8, Feb 24th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/02/llvm-weekly-8-feb-24th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2014 06:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/02/llvm-weekly-8-feb-24th-2014.html</guid><description>
&lt;p>Welcome to the eighth issue of LLVM Weekly, a weekly newsletter (published every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related projects. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by &lt;a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex Bradbury&lt;/a>. Subscribe to future issues at &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org&lt;/a> and pass it on to anyone else you think may be interested.

A followup post is promised describing the approach they've decided to take. The article is is written so as to be accessible to those who may not be familiar with GC implementation. He also raises some interesting issues with gcroot, even when using it for a non-relocating collector.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Some may remember the &lt;a href="http://dagger.repzret.org/">Dagger project&lt;/a> for decompilation of programs to LLVM IR from EuroLLVM 2013 (&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2013-04/bougacha-slides.pdf">slides&lt;/a>). The promised source code release didn't happen, but the developers have &lt;a href="http://dagger.repzret.org/update-feb-2014/">posted an update&lt;/a> detailing what they've been up to. There have been a lot of design changes, and some of the work has been submitted upstream as patches to LLVM MC. "At this point we don't really have a schedule; whenever we feel a patch is ready to go, we submit it to the community. The goal being, once we're done, our work becomes a full part of LLVM, where we and all contributors can continue to advance it!"&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Tamás Szelei has written up a &lt;a href="http://szelei.me/code-generator/">useful guide to implementing a code generator with libclang and Python&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The Emscripten project is &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/emscripten-discuss/mZMkX3uBG4s">getting ready to use its 'fastcomp' LLVM backend by default&lt;/a>. Previously they had a series of passes written in Javascript to convert from LLVM IR to Javascript, but this is now implemented as a C++ LLVM backend. See &lt;a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/LLVM-Backend">their wiki&lt;/a> for more info.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Agner has &lt;a href="http://agner.org/optimize/blog/read.php?i=311#311">updated his popular optimisation manuals&lt;/a> to include test results for AMD Steamroller processors, as well as adding some more AVX-512 information.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://dwarfstd.org">DWARF Debugging Information Format Committee&lt;/a> are welcoming comments, suggestions or proposals for changes to DWARF &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/35175/">until March 31st&lt;/a>. Although DWARF Version 5 is 'nearing completion', it seems that no drafts have been published so you'll have to base your comments on DWARF 4. Do drop me a note if you know otherwise.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>There have been &lt;a href="http://sylvestre.ledru.info/blog/2014/02/22/some-updates-on-llvm-org">several updates&lt;/a> to &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/apt/">http://llvm.org/apt/&lt;/a>. The upcoming Ubuntu 14.04 is now a supported distribution, and additionally both the stable and development versions of LLVM/Clang are built and can be installed side-by-side.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Renato Golin &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/35229">reminds us&lt;/a> that although work is underway to update all buildbots to support C++11, the switch to use &lt;code>-std=c++11&lt;/code> has not yet been flipped, so you'll have to hold off on using C++11 features in LLVM/Clang patches for just a little longer.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Saleem Abulrasool &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70584">points to an issue running recent Clang on the Linux kernel&lt;/a> related to the integrated assembler. As regular readers will know, the behaviour was recently changed so that for backends which have an integrated assembler, any inline assembly will be validated by it during compilation, even when compiling with &lt;code>-S&lt;/code> (i.e. outputting assembly). The problem is that the Linux kernel is purposely including invalid assembly in some cases when outputting assembler files. Early responses are in favour of keeping current behaviour, people who are doing weird and wacky things can just use the &lt;code>-no-integrated-as&lt;/code> switch.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>In response to the earlier discussion about unwind behaviour in LLVM/Clang, Logan Chien has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70461">posted a detailed description of the problems he sees&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Kevin Qin writes &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70511">asking about adding register allocation constraints&lt;/a>. Often the mailing list threads which get highlighted in LLVM Weekly are about particularly hairy problems that don't currently have a good solution. I'm happy to see this problem has a simple solution though, as Tim Northover and Quentin Colombet point out the &lt;code>@earlyclobber&lt;/code> constraint can be used to ensure the output register allocated is different to the input registers.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>While working on changes to CodeGenPrepare, Quentin Combet noted his patch would introduce a dependency from libLLVMScalarOpts (where CodeGenPrepare currently lives) to libLLVMCodeGen. He &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70528">writes to the list&lt;/a> asking for views on how to solve this problem. The forming consensus seems to be that it should just be moved to CodeGen. Potentially, any IR pass that depends directly on TargetLowering should be moved also. The move to CodeGenPrepare to lib/CodeGen has now &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201912">been committed&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Per Viberg is &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/35185">soliciting comments&lt;/a> on his design draft for improving the detection of uninitialized arguments.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The llvm-profdata tool was introduced. This tool will merge profile data generated by PGO instrumentation in Clang, though may later pick up more functionality. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201535">r201535&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>In a long overdue cleanup, various member variables were renamed from TD to DL to match the renaming of TargetData to DataLayout. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201581">r201581&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201827">r201827&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201833">r201833&lt;/a>. Additionally, DebugLoc variables which were named DL have now been renamed to DbgLoc so as not to be confused with DataLayout. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201606">r201606&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>MCAsmParser now supports required parameters in macros, increasing GNU assembler compatibility. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201630">r201630&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A new TargetLowering hook, &lt;code>isVectorShiftByScalarCheap&lt;/code> was added to indicate whether it's significantly cheaper to shift a vector by a scalar rather than by another vector with different values for different lanes. This is used by the new &lt;code>OptimizeShuffleVectorInst&lt;/code> in CodeGenPrepare which tries to sink shufflevector instructions down to the basic block they're used so CodeGen can determine if the right hand of a shift is really a scalar. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201655">r201655&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Private linkage is now properly supported for MachO. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201700">r201700&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>getNameWithPrefix and getSymbol were moved from TargetLowering to TargetMachine, which removes the dependency from Target to CodeGen. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201711">r201711&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The PGO instrumentation will now compute counts in a separate AST traversal. The reasons for and advantages of this change are documented in detail in the commit message. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201528">r201528&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Some initial work was committed on documenting available attributes in Clang. Attribute authors are encouraged to submit missing documentation (the method of documentation is described in the addition to the InternalManual.rst). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201515">r201515&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The IdenticalExprChecker has been extended to check the two branches of an if as well as logical and bitwise expressions. For those not familiar, this checker tries to warn about the unintended use of identical expressions. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201701">r201701&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201702">r201702&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>CGRecordLayoutBuilder has been completely rewritten to remove cruft, simplify the implementation, and to work in one pass. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201907">r201907&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The CastSizeChecker was taught how to correctly deal with flexible array members. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201583">r201583&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A number of thread-safety attributes have been renamed (with their old name silently deprecated). e.g. &lt;code>lockable&lt;/code> is now &lt;code>capability&lt;/code>, &lt;code>exclusive_locks_required&lt;/code> is now &lt;code>requires_capability&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201585">r201585&lt;/a>. Additionally, the documentation was updated and greatly expanded. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201598">r201598&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Initial virtual file system support &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/34941">discussed previously on the mailing list&lt;/a> has landed. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201618">r201618&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201635">r201635&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The vcvtX intrinsics were added for v8 ARM as opposed to only being recognised when targeting AArch64. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201661">r201661&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The hard-float ARM EABI (often known as gnueabihf) is now supported for FreeBSD. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201662">r201662&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang will now provide &lt;code>max_align_t&lt;/code> in C11 and C++11 modes. Note the complaint in the commit message though that &lt;code>max_align_t&lt;/code> as defined is not 'good' or 'useful'. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201729">r201729&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Again, there were a number of commits related to increasing compatibility with the MS ABI. None of them immediately leaped out at me as worth highlighting individually, so I recommend you have a flick through last weeks commits if you're particularly interested.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Rudimentary support for a standalone compiler-rt build system was added, which will allow the compiler-rt libraries to be built seperately from LLVM/Clang. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201647">r201647&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201656">r201656&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Assembly functions for AddressSanitizer on x86/amd64 were added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201650">r201650&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LLDB gained a hardware watchpoint implementation for FreeBSD &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201706">r201706&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Polly gained support for polyhedral dead code elimination. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201817">r201817&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A patch was added to lldb to provide initial support for the Hexagon DSP. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201655">r201665&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #7, Feb 17th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/02/llvm-weekly-7-feb-17th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2014 04:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/02/llvm-weekly-7-feb-17th-2014.html</guid><description>

Do drop me a line if you think I'm missing something interesting. There haven't been that many external news stories or blog posts (that I've found) in the last week, but it's been a particularly busy week on the mailing lists with a whole bunch of interesting discussions or RFCs.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/7">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://ellcc.org/">ELLCC Embedded Compiler Collection&lt;/a> now &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70441">has precompiled builds available&lt;/a> for ARM, i386, Mips, PowerPC and x86-64. Handily, these are all statically linked. The aim of ELLCC is to provide an easy to use multi-target cross compilation environment for embedded systems, and is of course based on LLVM and clang.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The next Waterloo Region LLVM Social &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.debugging.lldb.devel/3237/">has been announced for Feb 20th&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The next Paris LLVM Social &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70330">will take place on Feb 24th&lt;/a>, hosted by Mozilla.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Philip Reames contributed an RFC on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70430">using GetElementPtr as the canonical form for pointer addressing in LLVM IR before CodeGenPrepare&lt;/a>. The motivation behind this proposal will be interesting to many, particularly the Rust community and other language implementors looking to target LLVM. Philip and his colleagues (at Azul Systems I believe) are looking to support precise garbage collection in LLVM, and excitingly a complete upstreamable implementation should be coming "relatively shortly. (i.e. months, not weeks, not years)"&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>As a followup to last week's discussions on the GCC mailing list, Renato Golin has written a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gcc.devel/134419/">detailed proposal on how LLVM and GCC developers can co-operate&lt;/a>. He is welcoming responses &lt;a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=4769281&amp;amp;cid=46209457">on Slashdot&lt;/a>. Chris Lattner is very much in favour of the effort, though points out that there are some lists already used for this purpose (such as the 'Itanium ABI list', which I assume refers to &lt;a href="http://sourcerytools.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/cxx-abi-dev">cxx-abi-dev&lt;/a>) and perhaps other similar vendor-neutral mailing lists could be created.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Tom Roeder has posted an &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70274">RFC on the integration of control-flow integrity techniques in to LLVM&lt;/a>. Control-flow integrity (CFI) helps to protect against a variety of attacks by ensuring control flow at run time matches a path determined ahead of time, and is described in &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69217/ccs05-cfi.pdf">this 2005 paper&lt;/a>. Tom has an implementation that has been tested on Chromium, producing an overhead of ~4% for the dromaeo benchmark. JF Bastien responded indicating the PNaCl team would be interested in this work, while other respondents discussed representing a jump table in LLVM IR as opposed to inline assembly.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Jordan Rose kicked off a discussion on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/35023">the future of the clang static analyzer&lt;/a>. One issue he raises is how to mark issues as false positives, hopefully in a more sophisiticated way than disabling checkers. He also mentions long term plans for adding a full-program analysis mode that would work across translation units. Ted Kremenek &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/35025">follows up&lt;/a> with more details about treating reported diagnostics as 'issues' which might be suppressed individually.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Andrew Bokhanko from Intel initiated a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/34995">discussion on adding some sort of SIMD pragma to Clang&lt;/a>. Options include upstreaming the implementation of OpenMP 4's &lt;code>#pragma omp simd&lt;/code> from &lt;a href="http://clang-omp.github.com">clang-omp&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Mahdi Hamzeh writes to the mailing list with a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70348">query about if-converting before register allocation&lt;/a>. Andrew Trick points to the EarlyIfConverter, which can be run before register allocation but only generates conditional moves rather than predicating instructions. He &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70354">suggests an approach&lt;/a> for implementing if-conversion as a target-specific pass.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Vadim Chugunov &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70280">kicks off a discussion on a compiler-rt roadmap&lt;/a>. Issues include a potential rename, whether libunwind should be removed, and ensuring that it builds for all platforms that LLVM can target.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Matt Arsenault is &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70390">seeking ideas on solving a problem where loop induction variables are larger than they need to be&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Howard Hinnant is stepping down as code owner of libc++ and it &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/70419">looks like Marshall Clow&lt;/a> is going to take over. Many LLVM devs also drop by to thank Howard for his hard work on libc++.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Ted Kremenek gives a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/35049">great summary of the status of ArrayBoundChecker and ArrayBoundCheckerV2&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>AsmPrinter::EmitInlineAsm() will no longer use the EmitRawText() call for targets with mature MC (MachineCode) support. The MCASMInfo::UseIntegratedAS field was added. When true, the integrated assembler will parse inline assembly even when emitting assembly output. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201333">r201237&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The RTDyld API learned to precompute the amount of memory required for all sections in a module, and reserveAllocationSpace to reserve the given amount of space. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201259">r201259&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LTO API gained &lt;code>lto_module_create_from_memory_with_path&lt;/code>, which is mainly useful for emitting warning messages from the linker. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201114">r201114&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>ScalarEvolution will now analyze the trip count of loops where there is a switch guarding the exit. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201159">r201159&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The notes on Phabricator now include a suggestion to provide a link to the Differential revision (the code review) on commits that have been reviewed in this way. Please do this! &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201160">r201160&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The AArch64 backend now recognises Cortex-A53 and Cortex-A57. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201305">r201305&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The ARM integrated assembler gained partial support for the &lt;code>.arch_extension&lt;/code> directive. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201471">r201471&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>There have been yet more updates to Clang's Microsoft ABI compatibility. Clang now understands Microsoft's &lt;code>pointers_to_members&lt;/code> pragma. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201105">r201105&lt;/a> as well as the &lt;code>vtordisp&lt;/code> pragma &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201274">r201274&lt;/a>. In other MS ABI developments, the &lt;code>-vm{b,g,s,m,v}&lt;/code> are now supported too. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201175">r201175&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The command line option &lt;code>-fstack-protector-strong&lt;/code> was added. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL2011120">r201120&lt;/a>. See also &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL200601">r200601&lt;/a> for info on the sspstrong function attribute.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Frontend support for the OpenMP &lt;code>if&lt;/code> clause was committed. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201297">r201297&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>You can use the &lt;code>--rtlib=compiler-rt&lt;/code> flag to attempt to link against compiler-rt rather than libgcc. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201307">r201307&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;code>-Wignored-pragmas&lt;/code> diagnostic was added, that will warn in any case where a pragma would have a side effect but is ignored. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL201102">r201102&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The name of the checker producing each diagnostic message is now available through &lt;code>getCheckName()&lt;/code>.

A later commit set the inlinecold-threshold to the same as the inline-threshold so that current inlining behaviour is maintained for now. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL200898">r200898&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Initial implementation for a lazy call graph analysis pass (for use with the upcoming new pass manager) was committed. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL200903">r200903&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The allowsUnalignedMemoryAccess function in TargetLowering now takes an address space argument.

The conversation moved to LLVM's &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#patents">developer policy on patents&lt;/a> and whether the LLVM or Clang mailing lists are a suitable place for their discussion.

I've been keeping the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly Twitter account&lt;/a> updated throughout the week, so follow that if you want more frequent news updates.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The canonical home for this issue &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org/issue/4">can be found here at llvmweekly.org&lt;/a>. &lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;h3>News and articles from around the web&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The biggest compiler-related news this week has been the discussions on the GCC mailing list. Things kicked off with &lt;a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2014-01/msg00176.html">Eric S. Raymond's post&lt;/a> suggesting that technical progress in GCC is being held back by concerns about reusing parts of GCC in a way that bypasses the copyleft license. Ian Lance Taylor &lt;a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2014-01/msg00181.html">responded&lt;/a> to point out that GCC now has a plugin system, albeit with an unstable interface, which mostly put a stop to that line of discussion. However a &lt;a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2014-01/msg00247.html">later post to the mailing list from Richard Stallman&lt;/a> has proved very controversial by claiming that "The existence of LLVM is a terrible setback for our community precisely because it is not copylefted and can be used as the basis for nonfree compilers". There's plenty of discussion of these comments around the web &lt;a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/582242/">at LWN&lt;/a>, Hacker News, Reddit, Slashdot etc. Although many of us may have a preference for non-copyleft ('permissive') free software licenses, RMS has consistently and over a long period of time argued that copyleft licenses ultimately do a better job of spreading free software and preserving its freedom. As such, it's not clear to me why this mailing list post has come as a surprise to many. I'm personally surprised he didn't bring up the fact that the BSD-style license used by LLVM contains no explicit patent grant (though LLVM does have a &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#patents">patent policy&lt;/a> to help protect its users).&lt;/p>&lt;p>Rapidly moving away from controversial topics, an exciting milestone for the LLVM project was hit this week. The &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL200000">200000th commit&lt;/a> has been applied. Takumi Nakamura was lucky enough to be the one to author that commit.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The Khronos group has &lt;a href="https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-releases-spir-1.2-specification-for-portable-encoding-of-opencl-dev">released the SPIR 1.2 specification&lt;/a>. SPIR is a standardised intermediate representation meant for use with OpenCL, and is based on LLVM 3.2 IR. With the release, the Khronos Group have open sourced a modified Clang 3.2 which can generate SPIR from OpenCL C programs as well as a module verifier.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Joaquín M López Muñoz has published a benchmark &lt;a href="http://bannalia.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/a-better-hash-table-clang.html">comparing hash table performance on Clang&lt;/a>. He compares GCC's libstdc++-v3 to the LLVM project's libc++.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The Cambridge (UK) LLVM socials &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/34548">are starting up again&lt;/a>, with the next one on the 29th Jan at 7.30pm. Sadly I can't make it, hopefully the next one!&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Chandler Carruth asks &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69689">whether LoopPass and LoopPassManager can be removed&lt;/a>. He lists the confusion and issues they cause, most damning to me is that they reoutinely modify IR from outside of the loop thus breaking the implied contract of a 'loop pass'. The discussion ended up with the proposal that LoopSimplify, LCSSA, and LoopVectorizer become function passes. As you can see from the LLVM commit section below, Chandler quickly submitted patches to do this which have been applied.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Vadim asks for input on his idea of &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69727">using LLVM to generate code with position-independent stacks&lt;/a>. This would be usual for implementing something similar to Python greenlets. Mark Seaborn points to &lt;a href="https://codereview.chromium.org/29743003/">some similar work&lt;/a> he has done which restricts memory access to a range of address space.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Tom Stellard has completed a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69778">suggested policy and process for LLVM minor releases&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Shea Levy, a maintainer for nixpkgs writes to the list with &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69662">the issues he has encountered&lt;/a>packaging LLVM and Clang for Nix.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Raul Silvera &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69781">asks for opinions on removing the ReadOnly attribute from math intrinsics&lt;/a> on the grounds that changes to the floating point environment (such as rounding mode) aren't modelled anyway. As Raul points out in a later followup "We currently appear to be at the worst of both worlds as we do not have support for this environment but are always being constrained by it."&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Sebastien Riou asks &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69670">how to force a MachineFunctionPass to be the last one&lt;/a>. Peter Cooper suggests that at the moment you can add the pass to the end of &lt;code>X86PassConfig::addPreEmitPass&lt;/code> or add the pass after the call to preEmitBass and before the ASM printer is added.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Jasper Neumann has spotted various cases where &lt;a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69601">LLVM leaves unnecessary register moves&lt;/a> in the generated code. Andrew Trick suggests copy-eliminating peepholes could be added after register allocation, but that in general there is reluctance to introduce extra complexity to optimise special cases involving multiple physical register copies due to the small impact they have on performance.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>David Chisnall enquires whether &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69711">LLVM relies on the assumption that the stack is in address space 0&lt;/a>. Matt Arsenault notes that OpenCL local variables currently work by created globals rather than alloca'ing a nondefault address space. He suggests the limitation stems from the fact a number of places in the compiler assume the address space is 0 and never check by retrieving the address space of the relevant pointer.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Christian Schafmeister has posted &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/34505">a preannouncement of his soon-to-be-released C++ refactoring tool&lt;/a>, written in Lisp. It makes use of clang's ASTMatcher/Refactoring library. I'm looking forward to the promised open source release.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>David Fang has posted a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/34507">summary of the status of libc++ on powerpc-darwin&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>LoopSimplify is no longer a LoopPass, instead it is both a utility function and a FunctionPass. The motivation was to be able to compute function analysis passes after running LoopSimplify, but the change has a bunch of other advantages described in detail in the commit message. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199884">r199884&lt;/a>. Additionally, the LCSSA (loop-closed SSA) pass was made a utility with a function pass and the LoopVectorizer became a FunctionPass. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL200067">r200067&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL200074">r200074&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The Constant Hoisting Pass was born. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL200022">r200022&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>InstCombine learned how to deal with vectors for most fmul/fvid/add/sub/mul/div combines. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199598">r199598&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199602">r199602&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Type-based alias analysis has, for the time being, been disabled when using alias analysis in CodeGen due to two shortcomings described in the commit message. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL200093">r200093&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>LTO gained new methods which allows the user to parse metadata nodes, extract linker options, and extract dependent libraries from a bitcode module. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199759">r199759&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The Sparc backend now supports the inline assembly constraint 'I'. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199781">r199781&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The x86 backend allows segment and address-size overrides for movs/lods/outs, fixing &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=9385">bug 9385&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199803">r199803&lt;/a> and more.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>llvm-ar no longer opens or fstats file twice. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199815">r199815&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>When compiling a function with the minsize attribute, the ARM backend will now use literal pools even for normal i32 immediates. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199891">r199891&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>There was a fair bit of activity on the R600 backend. I haven't had the time to properly summarise that activity or pick out the most important commits, so I recommend those interested take a look through the commit logs.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>JIT is now supported for Sparc64. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199977">r199977&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>llvm-readobj gained support for the PE32+ format (used for Windows 64-bit executables). &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL200117">r200117&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Registry::getCompletions was implemented. This returns a list of valid completions for a given context. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199950">r199950&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang gained basic support for the attribute &lt;code>returns_nonnull&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199626">r199626&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199790">r199790&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>getResultType on function and method declarations was renamed to getReturnType which is a semantically more accurate name. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL200082">r200082&lt;/a>. Similarly, getResultLoc was renamed to getReturnLoc. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL200105">r200105&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>All applicable accessors in FunctionProtoType have been renamed from &lt;code>*argument*&lt;/code> to &lt;code>*parameter*&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199686">r199686&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Clang was taught to look in its installation libdir for libraries such as libc++ when the installation is within the system root. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199769">r199769&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A module.map file is now required to load a module. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199852">r199852&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Other project commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>lldb learned the 'step-avoid-libraries' setting, which allows a user to list libraries to avoid. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199943">r199943&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>In compiler-rt, support was added for intercepting and sanitizing arguments passed to printf functions in AddressSanitizer and ThreadSanitizer. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL1999729">r199729&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>A fix was committed to ThreadSanitizer to prevent deadlocking after a fork. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL1999993">r199993&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Dragonegg can now be built with CMake. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199994">r199994&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Compiler-rt gained support in its udiv/umod implementations for ARMv4 which lacks bx and clz. Code changes also resulting in a 30%+ performance improvement on the Raspberry Pi (armv7, ARM1176) and 5-10% on a Cortex A9. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL200001">r200001&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>In AddressSanitizer on Android, all AddressSanitizer output is duplicated to the system log. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL1999887">r199887&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>lld gained support for emitting a PE32+ file header. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL200128">r200128&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>lldb now supports Haswell on x86-64. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199854">r199854&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>LLVM Weekly - #3, Jan 20th 2014</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/01/llvm-weekly-3-jan-20th-2014.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2014 07:42:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2014/01/llvm-weekly-3-jan-20th-2014.html</guid><description>

Eli describes libjit as being more limited, yet easier to understand and to get going with due to its focus. He also makes interesting claims such as "to be honest, I don't think it's possible to create a really fast JIT within the framework of LLVM, because of its modularity. The faster the JIT, the more you’ll have to deviate from the framework of LLVM". As well as the comments directly on the blog post, there is some good discussion over &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1vf1lx/some_thoughts_on_llvm_vs_libjit/">at Reddit&lt;/a> .&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.capstone-engine.org/Version-2.0-RC1.html">Version 2.0-RC1 Capstone disassembly framework has been released&lt;/a>. Capstone is built using code from LLVM. The new release features reduced memory usage, faster Python bindings, and support for PowerPC among other changes.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://planet.clang.org/">Planet Clang&lt;/a> has been &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/34439">announced&lt;/a>. It is a news feed following blog posts from Clang and LLVM committers and contributors. The blog roll is fairly short right now, but you're welcome to submit your RSS feed via the email address in the announcement post.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The PDF of an upcoming paper to be presented at CGO next month has been released. &lt;a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~santosh.nagarakatte/papers/cgo2014-final.pdf">WatchdogLite: Hardware-Accelerated Compiler-Based Pointer Checking&lt;/a> proposes instruction set extensions to accelerate pointer checking functions and achieves a performance overhead of 29% in return for memory safety. The compiler extends (and is compared to) &lt;a href="http://acg.cis.upenn.edu/softbound/">SoftBound + CETS&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>David Woodhouse has posted a &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69440">detailed update on the status of 16-bit x86 in LLVM&lt;/a>. David has successfully built the 16-bit startup code of the Linux kernel and invites people to start testing it on real code.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Tom Stellard opens a discussion on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69428">stable LLVM 3.4.x releases&lt;/a>. A number of people volunteer their assistance and there seems to be general agreement that any 3.4.1 release would include bug-fixes only with no ABI changes.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Diego Novillo is looking to boost the performance of the SPEC benchmark libquantum &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69494">using profile info and loop unrolling&lt;/a>. Sean Silva did us all a great service by asking for clarification on what a "runtime unroller" means in this context. The answer is that the trip count (the number of times the loop is executed) is not known at compile time. The thread is worth a read if you're interested in loop unrolling or vectorization.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Aaron Ballman has stepped up as &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.scm/90431">code owner for the attribute subsystem&lt;/a> with unanimous approval.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Skye Wanderman-Milne was looking for help on &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69470">loop unrolling a single function using the C++ API&lt;/a>. Simply adding the LoopUnrollPass to a FunctionPassManager had no effect, but after some advice from the mailing list Skye did respond to confirm that the set of ScalarReplAggregates, LoopRotate, and LoopUnroll passes did have the desired effect.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Tobias Grosser asks why LLVM's LNT (used for performance tracking) defaults to &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69555">aggregating results by taking the minimum rather than an average&lt;/a>. Replies quickly hone on in the real problem at hand, which is that results are 'noisy' potentially due to other processes on the machine but also quantised to certain values due to the timer being relatively coarse-grained in comparison to the execution time for the benchmarks.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>This week's unsolved question is from Keith Walker, who's noticed that on ARM, the function prologue generated in GCC and LLVM ends up with &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69514">the frame register pointing to a different address&lt;/a>. The LLVM prologue results in the frame pointer pointing to just after the pushed r11 register (the saved frame pointer) while on GCC the frame pointer points to just after the pushed link register. The difference makes it difficult to produce a generic stack walker.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The MCJIT remote execution protocol was heavily refactored and it was hoped fixed on ARM where it was previously non-functional. There are still some random failures on ARM though, see &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=18057">bug 18507&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199261">r199261&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The cutoff on when to attempt to convert a switch to a lookup table was changed from 4 to 3. Experimentally, Hans Wennborg found that there was no speedup for two cases but three produced a speedup. When building Clang, this results in 480 new switches to be transformed and an 8KB smaller binary size. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199294">r199294&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for the &lt;code>preserve_mostcc&lt;/code> and &lt;code>preserve_allcc&lt;/code> calling conventions was introduced and implemented for x86-64. These are intend to be used by a future version of the ObjectiveC runtime in order to reduce overhead of runtime calls. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199508">r199508&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The configure script now checks for a sufficiently modern host compiler (Clang 3.1 or GCC 4.7) &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199182">r199182&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>More work on the new PassManager driver.

&lt;p>Welcome to the second issue of LLVM Weekly (and the first to appear on the LLVM blog). LLVM Weekly is a newsletter (published every Monday) covering developments in LLVM, Clang, and related projects. Thank you to everyone who has given positive feedback or suggestions, I'm planning in future editions to integrate some sort of statistics of git activity and contributions as well as activity on Bugzilla. LLVM Weekly is brought to you by &lt;a href="http://asbradbury.org">Alex Bradbury&lt;/a>. Subscribe to future issues at &lt;a href="http://llvmweekly.org">http://llvmweekly.org&lt;/a> and pass it on to anyone else you think may be interested.

This was received very positively and prompted some &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7031998">discussion on HN&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Registration for EuroLLVM is &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-04/">now open&lt;/a>. There's still time to submit your talk, poster or workshop proposals too.&lt;/p>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rust/blob/0.9/RELEASES.txt">Rust 0.9 has been released&lt;/a>. Rust is a systems programming language which targetting LLVM with a particular emphasis on type safety, memory safety and concurrency. One of the core Rust developers at Mozilla, Niko Matsakis, also gave a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfCtbGiHcg0">talk at linux.conf.au introducing Rust&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Coverity 7 &lt;a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coverity-unveils-new-version-of-development-testing-platform-239056251.html">now includes Clang compiler support&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;h3>On the mailing lists&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Apple are &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2014-January/069169.html">advertising for interns&lt;/a> with their LLVM compiler frontend and runtime teams this summer. Note internships are restricted to students.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Amara Emerson shares a &lt;a href="article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/34199/">proposal on handling the removal of the -mfpu option for AArch64&lt;/a>. This proposal aims to match gcc, where instead of &lt;code>-mfpu&lt;/code> to specify FPU/NEON, the same information will be passed using feature modifiers on &lt;code>-march&lt;/code>. It was pointed out that GCC also has &lt;code>-mcpu&lt;/code> to complicate things. It's hoped collaboration with the GCC devs will lead to a simplification that both can use.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Tobias Grosser has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69264">set up some new machines tracking performance at -O3&lt;/a> using &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/lnt/">LNT&lt;/a>, which is a framework used for performance tracking of LLVM over time. Tobias is asking for someone to step in and improve the LNT infrastructure to take advantage of this new data. LNT is written in Python, using Flask and SQLAlchemy so this would be an ideal project for someone interested in contributing to LLVM but perhaps doesn't match the typical profile of the LLVM contributor.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Timothy Baldridge asks whether &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69219">LLVM can inline external library functions in a JITted method&lt;/a>. Replies point out that for the specific example given (memcpy), LLVM is already able to inline. Kevin Modzelewski &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69236">describes a technique he's used&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Rafael Espíndola announces a new milestone, all in-tree backends &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69369">now use MCInst for printing assembly&lt;/a>. Out of tree targets will need to lower MachineInstr to MCInst to use the new printer and the recent &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL198030">conversion of the Sparc backend&lt;/a> to do this is probably as good a guide as any.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>As part of the effort to use C++11 inside the LLVM codebase, Chandler Carruth has asked anyone running build-bot to look at &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69242">upgrading to the new baseline compiler versions&lt;/a>. These are MSVC 2012, GCC 4.7, or Clang 3.1.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Jasper Neumann has been &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69383/">working on switch lowering using hashing&lt;/a> as an alternative to using a jump table. He later &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69389/">further elaborates on the technique&lt;/a> and points to an interesting looking paper, &lt;a href="http://ols.fedoraproject.org/GCC/Reprints-2008/sayle-reprint.pdf">Multiway Branch Code Generation&lt;/a> by Roger Anthony Sayle.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Kevin Modzelewski is encountering &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69349">disappointing bitcode parsing performance&lt;/a>, in particular when debug info is present. The issue is not identified or solved yet, I'm hoping to be able to point to an explanation of the problem in next week's issue!&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Chandler Carruth suggests that the &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69244">interprocedual analysis passes be merged in to the Analysis library&lt;/a>. Right now, various interprocedural analyses live in lib/Analysis/IPA and are built as the LLVMipa library. Chris Lattner agrees so we can expect the merge to happen in the not too distant future.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Chandler Carruth has &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.llvm.devel/69392">suggested&lt;/a> that the &lt;a href="http://www.llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html">LLVM coding standards&lt;/a> be updated so that namespaces are never indented, as opposed to the current confusing mixture. Despite the fact that debating whitespace is a favourite pastime of most programmers, the thread has been fairly uncontroversial thus far.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Milian Wolff wonders about &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/34168">using the clang C API to parse default values&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>Renato Golin is working towards &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.devel/34161">adding various pragmas to Clang&lt;/a> and is seeking feedback on how to implement it. A few people on the mailing list suggest it might be worth trying to instead implement these using &lt;a href="http://www.codesynthesis.com/~boris/blog/2012/04/18/cxx11-generalized-attributes/">C++11 generalized attributes&lt;/a> and perhaps enabling support for the syntax in C99.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The &lt;code>__has_attribute&lt;/code> feature macro is commonly used to detect support for a particular attribute in the compiler. Aaron Ballman &lt;a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compilers.clang.scm/90321">suggests extending it&lt;/a> so you can test for the precise form of attribute syntax you are after.&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>LLVM commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>The Sparc ASM parser has seen further development, learning to parse branch instructions, conditional moves, and floating point instructions and more. It also gained an initial disassembler implementation. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL198738">r198738&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199033">r199033&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL198591">r198591&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>In SimplifyCFG will now understand that when building a lookup table for a switch with no holes that it doesn't need a default result. According to the commit message, this saves 164KB off the clang binary in a bootstrap build. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL199025">r199025&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The new pass manager saw further developments. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL198998">r198998&lt;/a> and many others (prefixed with &lt;code>[PM]&lt;/code> in the commit logs)&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The SampleProfile pass saw further development. Profile samples are propagated through the CFG, heuristically converting instruction samples to branch weights. Work was done to extend and simplify the format of sample profile input files. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL198972">r198972&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL198973">r198973&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LoopVectorizer can use versioning for strided memory access. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL198950">r198950&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>In DataLayout, 'w' is now used rather than 'c' for win32 name mangling. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL198938">r198938&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The LLVM developer policy was updated to more clearly spell out how to submit patches to the project. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL198901">r198901&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>WriteAsOperand has been killed in favour of the the printAsOperand method. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL198836">r198836&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;p>The x86 backend learned some more AVX-512 intrinsics. &lt;a href="http://reviews.llvm.org/rL198745">r198745&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;h3>Clang commits&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;p>Support for the &lt;code>enable_if&lt;/code> attribute was added. This can be placed on function declarations to control which overload is selected based on the values of the function's arguments.

&lt;div style="text-indent: 0;">&lt;a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code&lt;/a> (GSoC) offers students stipends to participate in open source projects during the summer. This year, I was accepted to work on the &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-modernize.html">Clang C++ Modernizer&lt;/a>, a project formerly known as the &lt;i>C++11 Migrator&lt;/i>, driven by a team at Intel. The goals of the tool are to modernize C++ code by using the new features of new C++ standards in order to improve maintainability, readability and compile time and runtime performance. The project was featured in the April blog post “&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2013/04/status-of-c11-migrator.html">Status of the C++11 Migrator&lt;/a>” and has been evolving since, both in terms of architecture and features.&lt;br />&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;div>This article presents the improvements made to the tool in the last few months, which include my work from this summer for GSoC. For a complete overview of the tool and how to install it, please visit the documentation: &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-modernize.html#getting-started">http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-modernize.html#getting-started&lt;/a>. For a demonstration of the tool you can take a look at the Going Native 2013 talk given by Chandler Carruth: &lt;a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/The-Care-and-Feeding-of-C-s-Dragons">The Care and Feeding of C++'s Dragons&lt;/a>. clang-modernize is featured starting at ~33min.&lt;br />&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;h2>Transform &lt;u>all&lt;/u> Files That Make up a Translation Unit&lt;/h2>A major improvement since the last version is the ability to transform every file that composes a translation unit not only the main source file. This means headers also get transformed if they need to be which makes the modernizer more useful.&lt;br />&lt;br />To avoid changing files that shouldn’t be changed, e.g. system headers or headers for third-party libraries, there are a few options to control which files should be transformed:&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/extra/ModernizerUsage.html#cmdoption-include">-include&lt;/a> Takes a comma-separated list of paths allowed to be transformed. All files within the entire directory tree rooted at each given path are marked as modifiable. For safety, the default behaviour is that no extra files will be transformed.&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/extra/ModernizerUsage.html#cmdoption-exclude">-exclude&lt;/a> Takes a comma-separated list of paths forbidden to be transformed. Can be used to prune out subtrees from included directory trees.&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/extra/ModernizerUsage.html#cmdoption-include-from">-include-from&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/extra/ModernizerUsage.html#cmdoption-exclude-from">-exclude-from&lt;/a> Respectively equivalent to -include and -exclude but takes a filename as argument instead of a comma-separated list of paths. The file should contain one path per line.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Example, assuming a directory hierarchy of:&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>src/foo.cpp&lt;/li>&lt;li>include/foo.h&lt;/li>&lt;li>lib/third-party.h&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>to transform both &lt;i>foo.cpp&lt;/i> and &lt;i>foo.h&lt;/i> but leave &lt;i>third-party.h&lt;/i> as is, you can use one of the following commands:&lt;br />&lt;div style="padding-left: 25px;">&lt;pre style="color: #555555;">clang-modernize -include=include/ src/foo.cpp -- -std=c++11 -I include/ -I lib/&lt;/pre>&lt;pre style="color: #555555;">clang-modernize -include=. -exclude=lib/ src/foo.cpp -- -std=c++11 -I include/ -I lib/&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2>The Transforms&lt;/h2>Right now there is a total of 6 transforms, two of which are new:&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/extra/AddOverrideTransform.html">Add-Override Transform&lt;/a>&lt;br />Adds the ‘override’ specifier to overriden member functions.&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/extra/LoopConvertTransform.html">Loop Convert Transform&lt;/a>&lt;br />Makes use of for-ranged based loop.&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/extra/PassByValueTransform.html">Pass-By-Value Transform&lt;/a> [new]&lt;br />Replaces const-ref parameters that would benefit from using the pass-by-value idiom.&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/extra/ReplaceAutoPtrTransform.html">Replace Auto-Ptr Transform&lt;/a> [new]&lt;br />Replaces uses of the deprecated &lt;tt>std::auto_ptr&lt;/tt> by &lt;tt>std::unique_ptr&lt;/tt>.&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/extra/UseAutoTransform.html">Use-Auto Transform&lt;/a>&lt;br />Makes use of the auto type specifier in variable declarations.&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/extra/UseNullptrTransform.html">Use-Nullptr Transform&lt;/a>&lt;br />Replaces null literals and macros by nullptr where applicable.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;h3>Improvement to Add-Override&lt;/h3>Since the last article in April, the Add-Override Transform has been improved to handle user-defined macros. Some projects, like LLVM, use a macro that expands to the ‘override’ specifier for backward compatibility with non-C++11-compliant compilers. clang-modernize can detect those macros and use them instead of the ‘override’ identifier.&lt;br />&lt;br />The command line switch to enable this functionality is &lt;b>-override-macros&lt;/b>.&lt;br />&lt;br />Example:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div style="padding-left: 25px;">&lt;tt>clang-modernize &lt;b>-override-macros&lt;/b> foo.cpp&lt;/tt>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="font-size: 15px;

By changing to pass-by-value semantics, a copy can be avoided if an rvalue argument is provided. For lvalue arguments, the number of copies remains unchanged.&lt;br />&lt;br />The transform is currently limited to constructor parameters that are copied into class fields.&lt;br />&lt;br />Example:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div style="padding-left: 25px;">&lt;tt>clang-modernize pass-by-value.cpp&lt;/tt>&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="color: black;

Contributions are most welcomed in this area! &lt;br />&lt;div>&lt;h2>Usability Improvements&lt;/h2>We also worked hard on improving the overall usability of the modernizer. Invoking the modernizer now requires fewer arguments since most of the time the arguments can be inferred. &lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>If no compilation database or flags are provided, -std=c++11 is assumed.&lt;/li>&lt;li>All transforms are enabled by default.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Files don’t need to be explicitly listed if a compilation database is provided. The modernizer will get files from the compilation database. Use -include to choose which ones.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Two new features were also added.&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>Automatically reformat code affected by transforms using &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibFormat.html">LibFormat&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>&lt;li>A new command line switch to choose transforms to apply based on compiler support.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;h3>Reformatting Transformed Code&lt;/h3>&lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibFormat.html">LibFormat&lt;/a> is the library used behind the scenes by &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html">clang-format&lt;/a>, a tool to format C, C++ and Obj-C code. &lt;i>clang-modernize&lt;/i> uses this library as well to reformat transformed code. When enabled with -format, the default style is LLVM. The -style option can control the style in a way identical to clang-format.&lt;br />&lt;br />Example:&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>&lt;br />&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>format.cpp&lt;/b>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="margin-bottom: 8pt;

This option enables all transforms the given compilers support.&lt;br />&lt;br />As an example, imagine that your project dropped a dependency to a “legacy” version of a compiler. You can automagically modernize your code to the new minimum versions of the compilers you want to support:&lt;br />&lt;br />To support Clang &amp;gt;= 3.1, GCC &amp;gt;= 4.6 and MSVC 11:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div style="padding-left: 25px;">&lt;pre>clang-modernize -format -for-compilers=clang-3.1,gcc-4.6,msvc-11 foo.cpp&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;br />For more information about this option and to see which transforms are available for each compilers, please read &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/extra/ModernizerUsage.html#cmdoption-for-compilers">the documentation&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;h2> What’s next?&lt;/h2>The ability to transform many translation units in parallel will arrive very soon. Think of &lt;i>clang-modernize -j&lt;/i> as in make and ninja. Modernization of large code bases will become much faster as a result.&lt;br />&lt;br />More transforms are coming down the pipe as well as improvements to existing transforms such as the pass-by-value transform.&lt;br />&lt;br />We will continue fixing bugs and adding new features.

&lt;p>There has been a lot of work lately towards bringing an LLVM toolchain to the Windows platform (see &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2013/09/a-path-forward-for-llvm-toolchain-on.html">A path forward for an LLVM toolchain on Windows&lt;/a>). One result of that work is a new driver mode for Clang: &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#clang-cl">clang-cl&lt;/a>. This mode makes Clang understand the same kind of command-line arguments as Visual Studio's compiler, cl.exe. For example, a typical command to compile a file into an executable with Clang might be "clang hello.cc -o hello", whereas with cl.exe, one would use "cl.exe hello.cc /Fehello". Now one can use the latter syntax with Clang by substituting "cl.exe" with "clang-cl". This makes it easy to use Clang for existing projects in Visual Studio.&lt;/p> &lt;p>For the most part, clang-cl accepts exactly the same arguments as cl.exe. However, it also accepts some Clang-specific options. One such option that was added recently is &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#the-fallback-option">the /fallback flag&lt;/a>. The purpose of this flag is to make it easy to use clang-cl even in projects where Clang cannot yet compile all of the code. This post gives an example of how /fallback can be used.&lt;/p> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;p>The way clang-cl works in /fallback mode is that it first tries to compile the code with Clang, and if that fails for some reason it falls back to compiling with cl.exe. Consider the following two files, where main.cpp can be compiled by Clang, but printer.cpp cannot:&lt;/p> &lt;pre style="text-indent: 0px;">&lt;br />printer.cpp:&lt;br />&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;br />void print_hello(const char *s) {&lt;br /> std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "Hello from " &amp;lt;&amp;lt; s &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "!" &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre> &lt;pre style="text-indent: 0px;">&lt;br />main.cpp:&lt;br />&lt;br />extern void print_hello(const char*);&lt;br />int main(int argc, char **argv) {&lt;br /> print_hello(argv[0]);&lt;br /> return 0;&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre> &lt;p>clang-cl cannot compile printer.cpp since it includes iostream which uses language features that are not completely supported yet (hopefully they will be soon). However, clang-cl can still compile the two files in fallback mode:&lt;/p> &lt;pre style="text-indent: 0px;">clang-cl /fallback /Fehello main.cpp printer.cpp&lt;/pre> &lt;p>Clang will compile main.cpp successfully, print some error messages about the features it does not support for printer.cpp, and fall back to the cl.exe compiler for that file. The compiled files will be linked together into hello.exe.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Note that this is not fool proof: even if clang-cl thinks it has compiled a file successfully, there can be bugs in the generated code that cause failures at link- or run-time.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Currently, the fallback mode will cause clang-cl to fall back on any kind of error. Going forward, it will be changed to only fall back on certain kinds of internal errors, and as Clang's Windows support improves, the fallback mode will eventually become unnecessary and removed. It is still early days for clang-cl, but you can try it out for yourself by downloading the toolchain from the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/builds/">LLVM Snapshot Builds website&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OpenMP* project</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/10/openmp-project.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2013 03:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/10/openmp-project.html</guid><description>

I am proud to announce that as of September 21, libc++ has a full implementation of the C++1Y standard library. &lt;br />&lt;br />In April of 2013, the C++ standards committee approved a draft version of the next revision of the C++ language, called "C++1Y". (C++11 was called "C++0x" while in development). We hope that this draft standard will be approved next year, and become C++14. &lt;br />&lt;br />The draft standard includes changes to both the language and the standard library. These changes are designed to correct some mistakes that have been discovered in the C++11 standard and to add new features.&lt;br />&lt;br />Both clang and libc++ are being enhanced to support this new standard, and they each have a web page to show their current progress: &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html">clang C++1Y Status&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://libcxx.llvm.org/cxx1y_status.html">libc++ C++1Y status&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />The C++ standards committee is meeting this week (September 23-28) to consider comments and defect reports in the C++1Y draft standard, and there will certainly be changes made.&lt;br />&lt;br />We could have waited until the final version of the C++1Y standard was approved; that would certainly have been less work. The draft standard will to be revised in September (and probably in February), so the libc++ implementation will have to change to track the standard.&lt;br />&lt;br />However, by implementing the draft standard has several advantages.&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>We gain experience in working with the new standard.&lt;/li>&lt;li>We found several places where the changes to the draft standard "exposed" other places were improvements can be made. For example, while implementing the new &lt;code>optional&lt;/code> feature made it clear that interface of the the comparison functions &lt;code>plus&lt;/code>, &lt;code>less&lt;/code> (and others) could be enhanced. The result of that was the new paper &lt;a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3749.htm">n3749&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>&lt;li>By implementating the standard, we can identify problems/inconsistencies in the draft standard. For example, when we implemented the new library feature &lt;code>dynarray&lt;/code>, we discovered that the interfaces for the allocator-based constructors for the container were &lt;em>wrong&lt;/em>; in particular there were cases where it was not possible for the compiler to determine the correct constructor to call. This was raised as &lt;a href="http://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/lwg-active.html#2255">LWG Issue 2255&lt;/a>, and will have to be resolved before the standard becomes final.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>A path forward for an LLVM toolchain on Windows</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/09/a-path-forward-for-llvm-toolchain-on.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2013 18:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/09/a-path-forward-for-llvm-toolchain-on.html</guid><description>
&lt;p>Over the past several months, contributors from Google and elsewhere in the community have begun actively working on bringing an LLVM toolchain to Windows in a way that would support and enhance a fully native development experience. This toolchain works with Visual Studio and the Windows development process that Windows developers are already using, making LLVM tools and technologies available to them. We want to cross the streams (in the Ghostbuster proton-pack sense) of the Visual Studio IDE and the LLVM-based C++ tools to enable developers to build C++ software better.&lt;/p> &lt;p>To that end, we’ve been driving many of the efforts around compatibility with Visual Studio and native Windows C++ code in Clang and LLD (the LLVM linker). Today, as announced at &lt;a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/The-Care-and-Feeding-of-C-s-Dragons">my GoingNative 2013 talk&lt;/a>, we are able to build a trivial C++ application that in turn links against native C++ libraries and uses them in real, interesting ways. This is a huge milestone for the project, and something we’re really excited to be talking more about. Lots of folks in the LLVM project came together to get the open source project here. Thanks to every single one of you.&lt;/p> &lt;p>Going forward, we would really like to see an increased level of involvement from Windows developers. We’re launching an &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/builds">alpha-build website&lt;/a> as part of llvm.org where you can get fresh builds of Clang, various Clang-based-tools, LLD, and the rest of the LLVM toolchain for Windows on a regular basis. These installable packages should make it dramatically easier to test and experiment with this new set of tools in your development environment. Please feel free to try it out, &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/bugs">file bugs&lt;/a>, and even &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#making-a-patch">submit patches&lt;/a> to help move the toolchain forward on this new platform. Keep in mind, we are following the tried-and-true open source release mantra of releasing early and frequently. These are alpha-quality releases intended at developers interested in helping us track down and understand bugs.&lt;/p> &lt;p>There is still a lot of exciting work left to make LLVM and the C++ toolchain built on top of LLVM fully support the Windows platform. Come join the fun, because this is one place where patches are truly welcome.&lt;/p> -Chandler Carruth</description></item><item><title>Clang Warnings</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/09/clang-warnings.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2013 17:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/09/clang-warnings.html</guid><description>
&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-64a5b270-651c-62fd-ef8a-a37c15d794b3">&lt;/span>&lt;br />Clang has two types of diagnostics, errors and warnings. &amp;nbsp;Errors arise when the code does not conform to the language. &amp;nbsp;Such things as missing semi-colons and mismatched braces prevent compilation and will cause Clang to emit an error message.&lt;br />&lt;br />On the other hand, warnings are emitted on questionable constructs on language conforming code. &amp;nbsp;Over time, certain patterns have been determined to have a strong likelihood of being a programming mistake. &amp;nbsp;Some examples of these include: order of operations confusion, mistaking similarly named language features, and easily made typos that still result in valid code.&lt;br />&lt;br />Although warnings may have false positives, the utility of finding bugs early usually outweigh their downsides. &amp;nbsp;Keep reading for a demonstration of Clang's warnings, as well as a comparison to GCC's warnings.&lt;br />&lt;div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;">&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-64a5b270-651c-62fd-ef8a-a37c15d794b3">&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-64a5b270-651c-62fd-ef8a-a37c15d794b3">&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The following code consists of &amp;lt; 200 lines of code, one library, and one header file, only used for printing.

In previous posts I described the process of porting the LLVM Kaleidoscope tutorial program to use MCJIT as its execution engine and introduced a lazy compilation implementation with the MCJIT engine. &amp;nbsp;The lazy implementation produced similar, and in some cases better, performance when compared with an implementation based on the older JIT execution engine, but it used more memory.&lt;br />&lt;br />In this post, I’m going to extend the new implementation to use MCJIT’s object caching interface. &amp;nbsp;This will give our interpreter a way to store pre-compiled versions of previously used function and retrieve them for execution in later runs of the program.&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;h3>Adding a Library Parsing Mechanism&lt;/h3>I’m going to base the object caching on a library loading model. &amp;nbsp;In theory we could cache any object that the execution engine generates, but to make effective use of the cache we need some way of knowing that what we’re loading matches something we previously stored. &amp;nbsp;For simplicity, I’m going to extend the Kaleidoscope tutorial to accept a command line argument that references an LLVM IR file to be loaded as a library. &amp;nbsp;Once that’s working, I’ll introduce the object caching mechanism.&lt;br />&lt;br />The IR loading is a fairly easy thing to add. &amp;nbsp;We’ll use a standard LLVM command line parsing template:&lt;br />&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">cl::opt&amp;lt;std::string&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">InputIR("input-IR",&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; cl::value_desc("input IR file name"));&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>Then in the main() function, we’ll add argc and argv parameters along with a call to parse the command line options.&lt;br />&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">int main(int argc, char **argv) {&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp;

Modules.push_back(M);&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">}&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>Our lazy compilation mechanism will take care of compiling this module when any function it contains is called.&lt;br />&lt;br />When we build the program now, we need to add ‘irreader’ to the list of libraries on the compile line.&lt;br />&lt;br />At this point, we can provide a complete IR file as input to our Kaleidoscope interpreter. &amp;nbsp;You can generate an IR file by capturing the ‘dump’ output of a module that has been created by our interpreter. &amp;nbsp;It’s easiest to do this using the old JIT-based implementation, since it keeps everything in one module. &amp;nbsp;Because the particulars of where an input file will come from are likely to be implementation specific, I’ll just leave it at that for now.&lt;br />&lt;h3>Implementing Object Cache&lt;/h3>The mechanism above to load IR files can be used with either the JIT or MCJIT implementations of the Kaleidoscope interpreter. &amp;nbsp;With the MCJIT implementation, there is a significant time hit for compilation the first time a library is accessed, but subsequent references will be very fast. &amp;nbsp;With the JIT implementation, the module parsed from IR is compiled lazily and so its responsiveness will be more uniform.&lt;br />&lt;br />However, MCJIT provides a mechanism for caching generated object images. &amp;nbsp;Once we’ve compiled a module, we can store the image and never have to compile it again. &amp;nbsp;This is not available with the JIT execution engine and gives MCJIT a significant performance advantage when a library is used in multiple invocations of the program.&lt;br />&lt;br />MCJIT uses a callback mechanism to allow clients to register a custom cache handler. &amp;nbsp;The handler must be a subclass of the ObjectCache class defined in ‘llvm/ExecutionEngine/ObjectCache.h.” &amp;nbsp;For this example, I’m going to use a very simple scheme that uses the input IR filename as a key and stores cached files in a subdirectory relative to the current working directory. &amp;nbsp;Obviously in a real product you’d want something more sophisticated, but for demonstration purposes this will work.&lt;br />&lt;br />Here’s the implementation:&lt;br />&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">// MCJIT object cache class&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;br />&lt;/span> &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">class MCJITObjectCache : public ObjectCache {&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">public:&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp;

In a previous post I described the process of porting the LLVM Kaleidoscope tutorial program to use MCJIT as its execution engine. &amp;nbsp;After navigating through a serious of road blocks we ended up with an implementation that was working as expected.&lt;br />&lt;br />So it works, but the next question is, “Is it any good?”&lt;br />&lt;br />A lot of people considering the transition from the older JIT execution engine to MCJIT have concerns about the possible performance implications, particularly related to the fact that MCJIT doesn’t support lazy compilation. &amp;nbsp;The older JIT engine will generate code for functions in an LLVM module one function at a time, delaying compilation of each function until it is about to be executed. &amp;nbsp;The MCJIT engine operates on entire modules, generating code for all functions in a module at once. &amp;nbsp;In the previous post, we modified the Kaleidoscope interpreter to create multiple modules as needed, but we’re still compiling the entire current module when a function is executed.&lt;br />&lt;br />So what does that look like in terms of performance?&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />The Kaleidoscope interpreter operates on input from stdin. &amp;nbsp;When you’re sitting at your keyboard typing functions and expressions, it seems perfectly responsive. &amp;nbsp;It would take a lot of typing to create a module large enough to have a noticeable compilation time. &amp;nbsp;Of course, we can also drive our interpreter by redirecting a file through stdin. &amp;nbsp;This will be useful for measuring performance. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, there aren’t a lot of large Kaleidoscope programs available that we can use as a benchmark.&lt;br />&lt;br />Instead I wrote a Python script that will generate random Kaleidoscope functions and expressions. &amp;nbsp;By varying a few script parameters you can change the characteristics of the generated Kaleidoscope script to simulate various workload scenarios (number of functions, operations per function, number of function definitions between execution and percentage of calls within functions). &amp;nbsp;My Python script also generates a bash script that uses the Linux ‘time’ utility to get some crude performance and memory usage measurements. &amp;nbsp;These results should not in any way be confused with accurate benchmark data, but they ought to at least give us a rough idea of where we are.&lt;br />&lt;br />I made some minor changes to add a divide operator and a new output function (printlf) and to eliminate unnecessary output to stderr so that we aren’t timing the ‘dump’ functions.&lt;br />&lt;br />Here’s how my new MCJIT-based toy compares to a version built with the older JIT engine:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-N9hwOu6Jbfw/Ue2Atl--6gI/AAAAAAAABNY/6-joqx1C12Y/s1600/InitialTiming.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-N9hwOu6Jbfw/Ue2Atl--6gI/AAAAAAAABNY/6-joqx1C12Y/s1600/InitialTiming.jpg" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;br />The numbers across the bottom here give some indication of the input being used. &amp;nbsp;The first number is the number of functions in the script, the second number is the number of functions called at least once and the third number is the total number of calls that will be executed.&lt;br />&lt;br />So it turns out that depending on the input the MCJIT version of the Kaleidoscope interpreter that we’ve created is anywhere between 1.25 and 5.5 times slower. &amp;nbsp;That’s disappointing but not really unexpected. &amp;nbsp;Remember that the JIT version never compiles functions that aren’t used, and that’s really the weakness that this comparison was intending to quantify. &amp;nbsp;The more functions are called, the closer our MCJIT version is to the JIT version, which is what we’d expect.&lt;br />&lt;br />We’ll talk about memory use later, but for now let’s just say that it follows a similar pattern.&lt;br />The input sets I have are pretty trivial, so the actual code generated isn’t particularly interesting for performance analysis. &amp;nbsp;I can tell you from experience that where both engines are able to use the same processor features they generate nearly identical code. &amp;nbsp;(There’s a lot shared under the hood.) &amp;nbsp;There are some new processor features that aren’t supported by the older JIT engine, but that’s not relevant for our current comparison.&lt;br />&lt;h3>Making MCJIT Lazy&lt;/h3>Now that we have some idea of what we’re up against, let’s turn to the task of making a version of the MCJIT toy that attempts to mimic the lazy-compilation mode of the old JIT engine. &amp;nbsp;In the version we’ve created to this point we’re delaying creation of our execution engine until something needs to be executed, but when we do compile we’re compiling everything in the Module, not just the functions that will be executed. &amp;nbsp;That’s an inherent part of MCJIT’s design, so to get around it, we’re going to have to create a new module for each function and put off compiling each module until it is needed for linking. &amp;nbsp;If you had a detailed knowledge of the code you’re compiling you could optimize function grouping, putting related functions together in a module and so forth, but for the current experiment we’ll take the most general approach possible.&lt;br />&lt;br />Once again, this is easier than you might expect.&lt;br />&lt;br />Let’s start by moving the code that compiles a module into a new method in MCJITHelper().&lt;br />&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">ExecutionEngine *MCJITHelper::compileModule(Module *M) {&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; std::string ErrStr;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family:

monospace;">&amp;nbsp; return NewEngine;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">}&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>Now the code in MCJITHelper::getPointerToFunction() that compiles the current module will look like this:&lt;br />&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">// If we didn't find the function, see if we can generate it.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">if (OpenModule) {&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; ExecutionEngine * NewEngine = compileModule(OpenModule);&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; return NewEngine-&amp;gt;getPointerToFunction(F);&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">}&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>It will also be helpful to have a function that ‘closes’ the current module.&lt;br />&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">void MCJITHelper::closeCurrentModule() {&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; OpenModule = NULL;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">}&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>We don’t want to call this from MCJITHelper::getModuleForNewFunction as you might expect, because that is called for immediate expressions as well as function definitions. &amp;nbsp;Instead, we’ll call it from the beginning of HandleDefinition(). &amp;nbsp;This will cause the current module to be closed each time a function with a body is defined, but will still allow immediate expressions to be included in the last open module. &amp;nbsp;We also need to call closeCurrentModule from compileModule if the module being compiled is the current module in order to handle the case of two consecutive immediate expressions.&lt;br />&lt;br />So far so good, but the problem we now face is that our current implementation of MCJITHelper::getPointerToFunction() and MCJITHelper::getPointerToNamedFunction() both assume that they will find all functions either in the current open module or an execution engine that has already been used to compile a module.&lt;br />&lt;br />To fix that we’ll need to change our data structures. &amp;nbsp;Instead of keeping a vector of modules and a vector of execution engines, we’ll use a map that correlates module pointers with execution engine pointers. &amp;nbsp;If a module has no execution engine pointer in the map that will mean the module has not yet been compiled.&lt;br />&lt;br />In our helper class definition, we replace this:&lt;br />&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">typedef std::vector&amp;lt;ExecutionEngine*&amp;gt; EngineVector;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">EngineVector &amp;nbsp;Engines;&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>with this:&lt;br />&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">std::map&amp;lt;Module *, ExecutionEngine *&amp;gt; EngineMap;&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>And with that we can re-write our getPointerToFunction methods to look like this:&lt;br />&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">void *MCJITHelper::getPointerToFunction(Function* F) {&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family:

&amp;nbsp;They iterate through our vector of Modules looking for a Module that contains a function with the name we are looking for. &amp;nbsp;In the first case, we also check to see if this is exactly the function we’re looking for. &amp;nbsp;(It might be a prototype.) &amp;nbsp;Once we’ve found the right module, we check to see if the module has a corresponding execution engine. &amp;nbsp;If it does, we ask that engine for a pointer to the function. &amp;nbsp;If not, we compile the module and then ask the new execution engine for the pointer. &amp;nbsp;This leaves modules in an uncompiled state until we need a function either for execution or to satisfy a linking request.&lt;br />&lt;br />You’ll notice that this code doesn’t populate the EngineMap. &amp;nbsp;We’ll do that in the compileModule() function instead, where we were previously adding the new engine to the Engines vector. &amp;nbsp;We’ll also need to change our clean up code in the MCJITHelper destructor.&lt;br />&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">MCJITHelper::~MCJITHelper()&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,

style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; // See if we have an execution engine for this module.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; std::map&amp;lt;Module*, ExecutionEngine*&amp;gt;::iterator mapIt = EngineMap.find(*it);&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; // If we have an EE, the EE owns the module so just delete the EE.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; if (mapIt != EngineMap.end()) {&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; delete mapIt-&amp;gt;second;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; } else {&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; // Otherwise, we still own the module. &amp;nbsp;Delete it now.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; delete *it;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; }&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">}&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>Note that once a module has been passed to an execution engine, the execution engine owns that module, so in each case we only need to delete a module or an execution engine, but never both.&lt;br />&lt;h3>Lazy Performance Analysis&lt;/h3>At this point, the MCJIT-based version of our Kaleidoscope interpreter should be compiling lazily just like the old JIT-based implementation did. &amp;nbsp;Let’s re-run our test workloads and see how it stacks up.&lt;br />&lt;br />Here are the new results.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2iD8rrxxxQI/Ue2A6LTlKlI/AAAAAAAABNg/5VPeiEOLVv0/s1600/LazyTiming.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2iD8rrxxxQI/Ue2A6LTlKlI/AAAAAAAABNg/5VPeiEOLVv0/s1600/LazyTiming.jpg" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;br />That looks quite a bit better. &amp;nbsp;The big spike in the fourth column is the case where each function is called immediately after it is defined. &amp;nbsp;The MCJIT implementation is still about 1.3 times slower with 5000 functions in that case, but previously that was one of the better points of comparison for MCJIT. &amp;nbsp;Now it’s the worst case scenario.&lt;br />&lt;br />Also notice that with the new “lazy” MCJIT implementation there are a few cases where our MCJIT-based interpreter is quicker than the old JIT-based implementation.&lt;br />&lt;h3>Memory Consumption&lt;/h3>Now let’s talk about memory usage. &amp;nbsp;You can probably see without measurements that our new “lazy” implementation is going to consume more memory than the old implementation. &amp;nbsp;We’re creating a new Module instance for each and every function that gets defined and a bunch more execution engine related objects every time one of these things gets compiled. &amp;nbsp;But how bad is it?&lt;br />&lt;br />It’s bad. &amp;nbsp;I’m not sure how far to trust the memory statistics I’m getting from the time utility, but assuming they at least reliable enough to be a rough guide the MCJIT implementation has some issues. &amp;nbsp;In the cases where the MCJIT implementation has a performance advantage the memory consumption can be as little as 1.5 times the JIT implementation, but in the worst case scenario of each function being called immediately after it is defined the MCJIT implementation can take up to 10 times more memory than the JIT implementation.&lt;br />&lt;br />What are we to make of this? &amp;nbsp;Well, let’s start with a sanity check. &amp;nbsp;As the introduction to the Kaleidoscope tutorial says the tutorial isn’t meant to be a good implementation -- “the code leaks memory, uses global variables all over the place, doesn’t use nice design patterns like visitors, etc... but it is very simple.”&lt;br />There are some very basic things going on that waste a lot of memory, and those are amplified in our MCJIT implementation. &amp;nbsp;For instance, when an immediate expression is used, we leave it in memory for the duration of program execution, even though we can be absolutely certain we’ll never reference it again.&lt;br />&lt;br />Also, I don’t really have a feel for whether or not the sample inputs I’m using have any correspondence to a real world usage pattern. &amp;nbsp;I haven’t done a detailed analysis of memory use, but at first glance it appears that a large chunk of the memory is being used to generate relocation tables for each generated object image. &amp;nbsp;In theory we could drop those tables as soon as the object is fixed in memory (that is, after the call to finalizeObject), but we don’t. &amp;nbsp;This problem is magnified by the fact that the workloads are heavily based on a network of random calls between functions, probably involving a disproportionately high number of cross module references. &amp;nbsp;I’ve made no attempt to optimize that.&lt;br />&lt;br />As I said, I just generated a bunch of random code and threw it at the interpreter. &amp;nbsp;That’s true of the performance numbers too, of course. &amp;nbsp;Remember, my goal here was just to try to get a ballpark feel for what the implementation looked like.&lt;br />&lt;br />My ballpark feel is that with the “lazy” implementation the performance is going to be just about as good as the old JIT implementation, but it’s going to use more memory.&lt;br />&lt;h3>Next Steps&lt;/h3>So what else can we do with this? &amp;nbsp;Why would anyone want to go to the trouble of switching to MCJIT just to get something that performed just about as well but used more memory?&lt;br />&lt;br />I could say that you’ll get better ongoing support and adoption of new LLVM enhancements with MCJIT. &amp;nbsp;While that’s true, it would probably leave you a bit frustrated.&lt;br />&lt;br />Instead, what I’m going to tell you is that MCJIT has a great feature that will give it a huge leg up on the old JIT engine in many real world usage scenarios. &amp;nbsp;But that’s going to have to wait until my next post….&lt;br />&lt;br />The full source code listing for this post along with the scripts for generating test input are available in the trunk of the LLVM source tree at &amp;lt;llvm_root&amp;gt;/examples/Kaleidoscope/MCJIT.&lt;br />&lt;div>&lt;br

&lt;div class="MsoNormal">You may have noticed that there are two different JIT execution engines in the LLVM project.&amp;nbsp; The older implementation (llvm::JIT) is a sort of ad hoc implementation that brings together various pieces of the LLVM code generation and adds its own glue to get dynamically generated code into memory one function at a time.&amp;nbsp; The newer implementation (llvm::MCJIT) is heavily based on the core MC library and emits complete object files into memory then prepares them for execution.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">MCJIT has several advantages, including broader platform support and better tool integration.&amp;nbsp; However, because it is designed to compile entire modules into object images the MCJIT engine doesn’t directly support some key features of the older JIT implementation, such as lazy compilation.&amp;nbsp; By lazy compilation, I mean deferring compilation of individual functions until just before the function is going to be executed.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">At this point you may find yourself saying, “Wait a minute?&amp;nbsp; Are you saying MC&lt;b>&lt;i>JIT&lt;/i>&lt;/b>doesn’t do ‘just-in-time’ compilation?!?”&amp;nbsp; Well…sort of.&amp;nbsp; It’s more of a dynamic code emitter than a true just-in-time compiler.&amp;nbsp; That said we’d like it to become a long term replacement for the old JIT so that we can reap the benefits of ongoing development in core MC code generation.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">So the question becomes, can we make MCJIT do what the older JIT engine does?&amp;nbsp; The current answer is, “I hope so.”&amp;nbsp; As a means of exploring this question, I decided to try to convert the Kaleidoscope tutorial to use MCJIT.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">The Kaleidoscope tutorial demonstrates a simple interactive interpreter (“toy”) designed to teach developers how to implement a simple programming language using LLVM.&amp;nbsp; Kaleidoscope is presented as a procedural language that supports floating point variables, function calls and a few basic operators.&amp;nbsp; The tutorial uses the JIT execution engine to produce executable code from user input.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">Since MCJIT was conceived as a drop in replacement for the older JIT engine, putting it into the Kaleidoscope tutorial should be easy, right?&amp;nbsp; Eh….keep reading and you can judge for yourself.&amp;nbsp; Along the way, you’ll see firsthand some of the key differences between these two engines.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;h3>First Steps&lt;/h3>&lt;h1>&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/h1>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">I’ll be starting where the Kaleidoscope tutorial ends.&amp;nbsp; If you want to follow along, you can grab the final Kaleidoscope source code from the LLVM source tree at&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;lt;llvm_root&amp;gt;/examples/Kaleidoscope/Chapter7/toy.cpp&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>&lt;div class="Code">&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">There’s a Makefile there too, but it is intended to build the program in place as part of a complete LLVM build, so we’ll be using a command line approach.&amp;nbsp; For now, you can just type the build command in the Kaleidoscope tutorial:&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">clang++ -g toy.cpp `llvm-config --cppflags --ldflags --libs core jit native` -O3 –o toy&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>&lt;div class="Code">&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">If you have the right tools in your path, that should build the tutorial for you.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">The first change we’ll need to make is to create an MCJIT execution engine instead of a JIT execution engine.&amp;nbsp; This is pretty simple.&amp;nbsp; The ExecutionEngine gets created in the main() function in toy.cpp using an EngineBuilder object with a call that looks like this:&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">TheExecutionEngine = EngineBuilder(TheModule).setErrorStr(&amp;amp;ErrStr).create();&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>&lt;div class="Code">&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">EngineBuilder creates a JIT engine by default, but you can request an MCJIT engine instead by calling the setUseMCJIT() function, as such:&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;

As such, it requires that we call ExecutionEngine::finalizeObject() to let it know we’re ready for the generated object to be put in its executable state.&amp;nbsp; We can do that just before calling getPointerToFunction() in HandleTopLevelExpression:&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">TheExecutionEngine-&amp;gt;finalizeObject();&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>&lt;div class="Code">&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">Now build with the command above, substituting ‘mcjit’ for ‘jit’ in the library list.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">clang++ -g toy.cpp `llvm-config --cppflags --ldflags --libs core mcjit native` -O3 –o toy&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>&lt;div class="Code">&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;h3>Handling Function Names&lt;/h3>&lt;h1>&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/h1>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">At this point, you’re up and running with MCJIT.&amp;nbsp;

happened?&amp;nbsp; Well, here’s the thing.&amp;nbsp; Our ‘toy’ program creates a single module, uses that to create an execution engine, then keeps adding all the functions it creates to that same module.&amp;nbsp; This works with JIT, which is just generating code for one function at a time.&amp;nbsp; MCJIT, on the other hand, compiles the entire module and expects it to stay compiled.&amp;nbsp; When you add something to it and call finalizeObject() again it will skip the compilation phase (because it thinks the module has already been compiled) and attempt to re-apply relocations.&amp;nbsp; Since the MCJIT memory manager marked the code sections for this object as R-X in the previous call to finalizeObject, the attempt to re-write the relocation crashes.&amp;nbsp; MCJIT should obviously handle this case more gracefully, but the relevant point here is that MCJIT won’t let you continue to modify a module after it’s been compiled.&lt;/div>&lt;div

time it compiles a previous module, but as it turns out that’s not as painful to implement as it might sound.&amp;nbsp; Our ‘toy’ program uses three global variables (TheModule, TheFPM and TheExecutionEngine) to handle all the functionality we’re interested in.&amp;nbsp; We’ll create a helper class to replace those three objects and coordinate their

thing here that might require explanation is the implementation of getFunction.&amp;nbsp; This is used when the interpreter wants to call an existing function.&amp;nbsp; Since we’re dealing with multiple modules now, we need to look for this function in all of the modules our helper class is handling.&amp;nbsp; If we find it in the module we’re currently working with, we can just use it, but if we find it in another module we need to create a prototype in the current module.&amp;nbsp; The function declaration we found in the other module will provide the function type.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">We’ll create a new global variable (TheHelper) and get rid of the three previously mentioned.&amp;nbsp; In main() we’ll replace the code that creates and initializes those three objects with a single line of code:&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="Code">TheHelper = new MCJITHelper(Context);&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">Now we just need to go through the code and replace uses of those three global objects with calls to our helper.&amp;nbsp; There aren’t as many as you might expect.&amp;nbsp; You can find references to TheModule in UnaryExprAST::Codegen(), BinaryExprAST::Codegen(), CallExprAST::Codegen(), and PrototypeAST::Codegen().&amp;nbsp; All of these except the last are just drop-in replacements.&amp;nbsp; In PrototypeAST::Codegen() we need to add a call to TheHelper-&amp;gt;getModuleForNewFunction() to get the last argument to Function::Create().&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier,

Function::ExternalLinkage, Name, M);&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>&lt;div class="CodeCxSpLast">&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">TheExecutionEngine is used only in HandleTopLevelExpression() and a direct replacement is suitable there, plus we can eliminate the call to finalizeObject since that will happen inside MCJITHelper::getPointerToFunction.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">TheFPM is used in FunctionAST::Codegen() but that’s not where we’ll want it for MCJIT purposes.&amp;nbsp; Since we aren’t creating an ExecutionEngine until we need to compile a Module, I’m also going to put the FunctionPassManager creation there and optimize all the functions in a Module just before code generation.&amp;nbsp; This isn’t strictly necessary, but it makes the code generation phase go a bit faster.&amp;nbsp; We can put the following in MCJITHelper::getPointerToFunction() just after the execution engine is created:&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">//

MCJIT.&amp;nbsp; When code is generated from a Module, a complete object file image is generated into memory.&amp;nbsp; As MCJIT’s runtime loader is preparing this object for execution, it will create a list of external symbols that need to be resolved.&amp;nbsp; It will then call the MCJIT memory manager’s getPointerToNamedFunction method in an attempt to resolve these external symbols.&amp;nbsp; (Why the memory manager? Because that’s the component that knows which address space the JITed code will be running in.)&amp;nbsp; The default memory manager (SectionMemoryManager) uses sys::DynamicLibrary::SearchForAddressOfSymbol() to try to link this symbol against the current process.&amp;nbsp; If it can’t find the symbol, the symbol gets reported as unresolved.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">We could solve the problem of linking dynamically generated objects by iterating through all the symbols in an object as it is loaded and calling sys::DynamicLibrary::AddSymbol() for each one.&amp;nbsp; In some circumstances that might be a good solution (as long as you aren’t worried about name conflicts).&amp;nbsp; However, I’d like to demonstrate an alternative solution which can be adapted to more general purposes.&amp;nbsp; I’m going to create a custom memory manager for linking purposes.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">My new memory manager will inherit from SectionMemoryManager and use the base implementation for the actual memory management.&amp;nbsp; It will also attempt to reuse the base symbol resolution, but if a symbol is not found, it will delegate symbol resolution to our MCJITHelper class, which can search other loaded objects.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">Here’s the code for the new memory manager:&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq">&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">class HelpingMemoryManager : public SectionMemoryManager&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">{&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; HelpingMemoryManager(const HelpingMemoryManager&amp;amp;) LLVM_DELETED_FUNCTION;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; void operator=(const HelpingMemoryManager&amp;amp;) LLVM_DELETED_FUNCTION;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">public:&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; HelpingMemoryManager(MCJITHelper *Helper) : MasterHelper(Helper) {}&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; virtual ~HelpingMemoryManager() {}&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; /// This method returns the address of the specified function.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; /// Our implementation will attempt to find functions in other&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; /// modules associated with the MCJITHelper to cross link functions&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; /// from one generated module to another.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; ///&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; /// If \p AbortOnFailure is false and no function with the given name is&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&amp;nbsp; /// found, this function returns a null pointer.

&lt;div class="MsoNormal">The LLVM project debugger (LLDB) has seen a recent upswing of activity around the LLVM 3.3 release.&amp;nbsp; While the debugger has long been the default tool with Xcode, its potential beyond Darwin has had room to grow.&amp;nbsp; Especially within the last year, the development community has grown beyond its roots with OS/X and iOS to include substantial contributions for Linux, Windows, and FreeBSD. In addition, experimental packages are available for a growing number of distributions including Debian, Ubuntu and Arch.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">Much of the potential draws from the architecture of LLDB.&amp;nbsp; The debugger is well suited to debugging the latest C++ code because of its reuse of LLVM and Clang.&amp;nbsp; This includes the LLVM dynamic execution engine (MCJIT) for expression evaluation, the LLVM disassembler and the use of the Clang AST parser.&amp;nbsp; The reuse of LLVM project components has kept LLDB lightweight and has focused developer efforts on the core tasks of being a good debugger.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">Overall, this modern debugger has been well designed from the ground up for multi-threaded debugging, lazy symbolication, versatile unwind, and a hierarchical command set including both C++ and Python interfaces.&amp;nbsp; The availability of these core interfaces allows LLDB to fulfill its name as a low-level debugger.&amp;nbsp; Developers can use the LLDB libraries for format-neutral access to information in object files such as debug information, symbols, types, functions, line tables and more.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;This information is useful to develop debuggers, symbolication tools, and analysis tools.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">Python is currently embedded inside of LLDB and available through an interactive interpreter.&amp;nbsp; The available command set allows arbitrary Python code to be run on breakpoints, watch-points, data summaries and formatters, and the like. The LLDB shared library can also be accessed in Python scripts on the command line.&amp;nbsp; Overall, the ability to customize LLDB behavior using arbitrary Python code, write extensions using Python, and to evaluate arbitrary C++ expressions contribute to the versatility of this project.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">Recent LLDB packages have closed some of the feature gap with LLDB on Linux relative to Darwin.&amp;nbsp; This includes support for multi-threaded debugging, watch-points and vector register sets.&amp;nbsp; In addition there have been many improvements to process control, expression evaluation, the build system and support of i386 targets.&amp;nbsp; Upcoming features include JIT debugging, core file support and support of new processor features.&amp;nbsp; Much of this work impacts any POSIX distribution including FreeBSD.&amp;nbsp; Currently, x86-64 Linux builds and targets are tested on trunk (using GCC and Clang) with every commit to LLVM, Clang and LLDB.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">The activity on Linux for x86-64 is just part of the picture.&amp;nbsp; A Windows branch has been developed with the first port of remote debugging to a non-Darwin platform.&amp;nbsp; Work is just underway to assess LLDB on FreeBSD, with ICC and for i386 targets.&amp;nbsp; In fact, the number of active contributors to LLDB has more than doubled in the last year alone.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">At this point in the growth of LLDB, feedback is very welcome, as we grow the test coverage and use the tool to debug increasingly more complex applications.&amp;nbsp; Increasingly, LLDB is a responsive debugger that can handle some of the harder cases of multi-threaded C++ debugging effectively.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="MsoNormal">For more information about LLDB architecture, features, source code, packages, feature status or build information, visit &lt;a href="http://lldb.llvm.org/">lldb.llvm.org&lt;/a>. &amp;nbsp;If you have questions or comments about this release, please contact the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/lldb-dev" target="_blank">lldb-dev&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;mailing list!&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div class="MsoNormal">&lt;br />&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>LLVM 3.3 Released!</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/06/llvm-33-released.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2013 11:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/06/llvm-33-released.html</guid><description>
LLVM 3.3 is &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/releases/">now available&lt;/a>! For details, you can read the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/releases/3.3/docs/ReleaseNotes.html">Release Notes&lt;/a>.&lt;p> LLVM 3.3 is a big release: it adds new targets for the AArch64 and AMD R600 GPU architectures, adds support for IBM's z/Architecture S390 systems, and major enhancements for the PowerPC backend (including support for PowerPC 2.04/2.05/2.06 instructions, and an integrated assembler) and MIPS targets.&lt;p> Performance of code generated by LLVM 3.3 is substantially improved: the &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2013/05/llvm-33-vectorization-improvements.html">auto-vectorizer&lt;/a> produces much better code in many cases and is on by default at -O3, a new SLP vectorizer is available, and many general improvements landed in this release. Independent evaluations show that LLVM 3.3's performance exceeds that of LLVM 3.2 and of its primary competition on many benchmarks.&lt;p> 3.3 is also a major milestone for the Clang frontend: it is now &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2013/04/clang-support-for-c11-and-beyond.html">fully C++'11 feature complete&lt;/a>. At this point, Clang is the only compiler to support the full C++'11 standard, including important &lt;a href="http://libcxx.llvm.org">C++'11 library&lt;/a> features like std::regex. Clang now supports Unicode characters in identifiers, the &lt;a href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org">Clang Static Analyzer&lt;/a> supports several new checkers and can perform interprocedural analysis across C++ constructor/destructor boundaries, and Clang even has a nice "&lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2013/04/status-of-c11-migrator.html">C++'11 Migrator&lt;/a>" tool to help upgrade code to use C++'11 features and a "&lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html">Clang Format&lt;/a>" tool that plugs into vim and emacs (among others) to auto-format your code.&lt;p> LLVM 3.3 is the result of an incredible number of people working together over the last six months, but this release would not be possible without our volunteer release team! Thanks to Bill Wendling for shepherding the release, and to Ben Pope, Dimitry Andric, Nikola Smiljanic, Renato Golin, Duncan Sands, Arnaud A. de Grandmaison, Sebastian Dreßler, Sylvestre Ledru, Pawel Worach, Tom Stellard, Kevin Kim, and Erik Verbruggen for all of their contributions pulling the release together.&lt;p> If you have questions or comments about this release, please contact the &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/llvmdev">LLVMdev mailing list&lt;/a>! Onward to LLVM 3.4!</description></item><item><title>LLVM 3.3 Vectorization Improvements</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/05/llvm-33-vectorization-improvements.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2013 07:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/05/llvm-33-vectorization-improvements.html</guid><description>
I would like to give a brief update regarding vectorization in LLVM. When LLVM 3.2 was released, it featured a new experimental &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2012/12/new-loop-vectorizer.html">loop vectorizer&lt;/a> that was disabled by default. Since LLVM 3.2 was released, we have continued to work hard on improving vectorization, and we have some news to share. First, the loop vectorizer has new features and is now enabled by default on -O3. Second, we have a new SLP vectorizer. And finally, we have new clang command line flags to control the vectorizers.&lt;br />&lt;h4> &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>Loop Vectorizer &lt;/h4>The LLVM Loop Vectorizer has a number of new features that allow it to vectorize even more complex loops with better performance. One area that we focused on is the vectorization "cost model". When LLVM estimates if a loop may benefit from vectorization it uses a detailed description of the processor that can estimate the cost of various instructions. We improved both the X86 and ARM cost models. Improving the cost models helped the compiler to detect benefitting loops and improve the performance of many programs. During the analysis of vectorized programs, we also found and optimized many vector code sequences. &lt;br />&lt;br />Another important improvement to the loop vectorizer is the ability to unroll during vectorization. When the compiler unrolls loops it generates more independent instructions that modern out-of-order processors can execute in parallel. The loop below adds all of the numbers in the array. When compiling this loop, LLVM creates two independent chains of calculations that can be executed in parallel. &lt;br />&lt;pre style="background: #ffffff; color: black;">&lt;html>&lt;body style="background: #ffffff; color: black;">&lt;pre>&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> sum_elements&lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">*&lt;/span>A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> n&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: purple;">{&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> sum &lt;span style="color: #808030;">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #008c00;">0&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">for&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> i &lt;span style="color: #808030;">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #008c00;">0&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span> i &lt;span style="color: #808030;">&amp;lt;&lt;/span> n&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span>i&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span>&lt;br /> sum &lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">=&lt;/span> A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>i&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">return&lt;/span> sum&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: purple;">}&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;/body>&lt;/html>&lt;/pre>The innermost loop of the program above is compiled into the X86 assembly sequence below, which processes 8 elements at once, in two parallel chains of computations. The vector registers XMM0 and XMM1 are used to store the partial sum of different parts of the array. This allows the processor to load two values and add two values simultaneously. &lt;br />&lt;pre style="background: #ffffff; color: black;">&lt;html>&lt;body style="background: #ffffff; color: black;">&lt;pre>&lt;br />LBB0&lt;span style="color: #808030;">_&lt;/span>4&lt;span style="color: #808030;">:&lt;/span>&lt;br /> movdqu &lt;span style="color: #008c00;">16&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>rdi&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>rax&lt;span style="color: #008c00;">,4&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>xmm2&lt;br /> paddd &lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>xmm2&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>xmm1&lt;br /> movdqu &lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>rdi&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>rax&lt;span style="color: #008c00;">,4&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>xmm2&lt;br /> paddd &lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>xmm2&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>xmm0&lt;br /> addq $&lt;span style="color: #008c00;">8&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>rax&lt;br /> cmpq &lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>rax&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>rcx&lt;br /> jne LBB0&lt;span style="color: #808030;">_&lt;/span>4&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;/body>&lt;/html>&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Another important improvement is the support for loops that contain IFs, and the detection of the popular min/max patterns. LLVM is now able to vectorize the code below: &lt;br />&lt;pre style="background: #ffffff; color: black;">&lt;html>&lt;body style="background: #ffffff; color: black;">&lt;pre>&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> fins_max&lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">*&lt;/span>A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> n&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: purple;">{&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> mx &lt;span style="color: #808030;">=&lt;/span> A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #008c00;">0&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">for&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> i &lt;span style="color: #808030;">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #008c00;">0&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span> i &lt;span style="color: #808030;">&amp;lt;&lt;/span> n&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span>i&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">if&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>mx &lt;span style="color: #808030;">&amp;gt;&lt;/span> A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>i&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span>&lt;br /> mx &lt;span style="color: #808030;">=&lt;/span> A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>i&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">return&lt;/span> mx&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: purple;">}&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;/body>&lt;/html>&lt;/pre>In the last release, the loop vectorizer was able to vectorize many, but not all, loops that contained floating point arithmetic. Floating point operations are not associative due to the unique rounding rules. This means that the expression (a + b) + c is not always equal to a + (b + c). The compiler flag -ffast-math tells the compiler not to worry about rounding errors and to optimize for speed. One of the new features of the loop vectorizer is the vectorization of floating point calculations when -ffast-math mode is used. Users who decide to use the -ffast-math flag will notice that many more loops get vectorized with the upcoming 3.3 release of LLVM. &lt;br />&lt;h4> SLP Vectorizer &lt;/h4>The SLP vectorizer (short for superword-level parallelism) is a new vectorization pass. Unlike the loop vectorizer, which vectorizes consecutive loop iterations, the SLP vectorizer combines similar independent instructions in a straight-line code.&lt;br />The SLP Vectorizer is now available and will be useful for many people.&lt;br />The SLP Vectorizer can boost the performance of many programs in the LLVM test suite. In one benchmark, "Olden/Power", the SLP Vectorizer boosts the performance of the program by 16%. Here is one small example of a function that the SLP Vectorizer can vectorize. &lt;br />&lt;pre style="background: #ffffff; color: black;">&lt;html>&lt;body style="background: #ffffff; color: black;">&lt;pre>&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">void&lt;/span> foo&lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">*&lt;/span> restrict A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">*&lt;/span> restrict B&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: purple;">{&lt;/span>&lt;br /> A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #008c00;">0&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #008c00;">7&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>B&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #008c00;">0&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">*&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #008c00;">11&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span>&lt;br /> A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #008c00;">1&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #008c00;">6&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>B&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #008c00;">1&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">*&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #008c00;">12&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span>&lt;br /> A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #008c00;">2&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #008c00;">5&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>B&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #008c00;">2&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">*&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #008c00;">13&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span>&lt;br /> A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #008c00;">3&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #008c00;">4&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>B&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #008c00;">3&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">*&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #008c00;">14&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: purple;">}&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;/body>&lt;/html>&lt;/pre>The code above is compiled into the ARMv7s assembly sequence below.

It was a lot of hard work by an amazing team of volunteer organizers lead by Tobias Grosser, Duncan Sands, Sylvestre Ledru and Arnaud de Grandmaison, plus the usual suspects of the previous events, and in the end there was very little that had gone wrong, even in the&amp;nbsp;slightest.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dvRd-sZEf_c/UYLE66SPUgI/AAAAAAAAA48/xqzFSGbGKN8/s1600/ens-01.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="132" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dvRd-sZEf_c/UYLE66SPUgI/AAAAAAAAA48/xqzFSGbGKN8/s200/ens-01.jpg" width="200" />&lt;/a>&lt;br />This was our biggest event yet, with 187 attendees, 12 talks, 2 tutorials, 7 lightning talks and 10 posters! The posters, slides and videos are available on the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2013-04/" target="_blank">EuroLLVM 2013 website&lt;/a>, as well as some idea on the abstracts, location (ENS, in Paris) and the great dinner cruise on Monday.&lt;br />&lt;br />You can also find on the site the results of our questionnaire, distilled and anonymized.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>The Talks&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OKtTowghfrg/UYLE-pI7_oI/AAAAAAAAA5I/28IT74VB5n4/s1600/keynote-01.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="132" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OKtTowghfrg/UYLE-pI7_oI/AAAAAAAAA5I/28IT74VB5n4/s200/keynote-01.jpg" width="200" />&lt;/a>The two key notes received high approval ratings (90+% overall). The first was Chandler's, speaking about the missing optimizations still lurking, hinting which ones would be low-hanging fruit, and others that we just have to fix nonetheless. On the second day we had Jakob with a nice break-down of source code into machine code and how it's executed on modern CPUs. Despite their highly technical nature, the talks were delivered in an easy-to-understand format, which the audience didn't find daunting.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NXxIevmJbmM/UYLFPSe5JZI/AAAAAAAAA6Q/HuPC-bTHg8k/s1600/talks.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="132" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NXxIevmJbmM/UYLFPSe5JZI/AAAAAAAAA6Q/HuPC-bTHg8k/s200/talks.jpg" width="200" />&lt;/a>We also had many good talks, from Debug Information (Eric's) to PowerPC implementation (Ulrich's) to OpenMP support (Bokhanko &amp;amp; Bataev's), where the announcement that Intel had open sourced their OpenMP on a compatible BSD-license, which is always good news! There were also talks about tools (lld) and Clang usage (AST Tutorial, Pragma Handling).&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wXSqgpeGPKI/UYLFJMIBMdI/AAAAAAAAA54/i7KmbwLRR0A/s1600/parallel-track.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="132" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wXSqgpeGPKI/UYLFJMIBMdI/AAAAAAAAA54/i7KmbwLRR0A/s200/parallel-track.jpg" width="200" />&lt;/a>Since we had two parallel tracks, I was worried that we'd get people divided and not get much visibility on the second track. Some people mentioned it on the questionnaire, but the number of reviews on both tracks are compatible, which shows that there was enough space and content for all tastes.&lt;br />&lt;br />Other comments reinforced the idea to have more visibility on the official tools (lldb, bugpoint, lli) as well as more basic-level tutorials on how to use LLVM and tools, not just how to hack it. Let this be a lead to you (yes, you!) propose tutorials next time.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Lightning Talks and Posters&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5_4ROuWX3JQ/UYLFNz7YbYI/AAAAAAAAA6A/DdBaB_LMYIY/s1600/posters.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="132" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5_4ROuWX3JQ/UYLFNz7YbYI/AAAAAAAAA6A/DdBaB_LMYIY/s200/posters.jpg" width="200" />&lt;/a>There were many interesting lightning talks, all very quick and efficiently exposed. Part of the reason why we had so many was that many of the talks that we couldn't fit were transformed into lightning talks, others in posters, others in both.&lt;br />&lt;br />The idea was that, since a lightning talk can convey only a limited meaning, having a poster and specifically a poster session, was important to promote discussions between interested parties. That was actually very relevant, because some of the feedback was that there was little extra time to reinforce or create new connections.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AMNAvjEukrs/UYLFC845YBI/AAAAAAAAA5g/OOX650oDlTk/s1600/lightning.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="132" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AMNAvjEukrs/UYLFC845YBI/AAAAAAAAA5g/OOX650oDlTk/s200/lightning.jpg" width="200" />&lt;/a>Again, there were topics from optimizations (like&amp;nbsp;adaptive&amp;nbsp;parallelization, user-defined optimization, FDO) to tools (MCLinker) to builds (Debian+LLVM), but perhaps the most unusual of the talks was&amp;nbsp;Henning's audio signal processing using LLVM and Haskell, in which we had a live demonstration of the hardware at work. It reminded me of early works from Kraftwerk.&lt;br />&lt;br />Of the 91 questionnaires returned, 94% said lightning talks were important and 90% that they would want to have it again in future events. Part of this acceptance, I imagine, is due to the extra connection you have with the presenter &lt;b>after&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;the presentation.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>The Social&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aBh8EkiCleo/UYLEvkhFxBI/AAAAAAAAA4Y/Fc0a6n8jcEY/s1600/cruise-03.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="132" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aBh8EkiCleo/UYLEvkhFxBI/AAAAAAAAA4Y/Fc0a6n8jcEY/s200/cruise-03.jpg" width="200" />&lt;/a>As highlighted above, there wasn't much time to socialize in between the talks, but there were specific coffee times, where the queue forced people to connect and meet others, the lunch time at the cafeteria, where finding a place to sit wasn't easy, so you'd end up sitting with completely unrelated people, and the amazing (let me say it again: &lt;b>amazing&lt;/b>!) cruise dinner.&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1yDJHmuvXSw/UYLEsNyCqfI/AAAAAAAAA4Q/aED2oI382Y0/s1600/cruise-02.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="132" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1yDJHmuvXSw/UYLEsNyCqfI/AAAAAAAAA4Q/aED2oI382Y0/s200/cruise-02.jpg" width="200" />&lt;/a>&lt;br />Floating easily through the Seine, admiring Paris' historical places from a very interesting point of view, we had a great meal and an enjoyable evening. I'd really like to thanks again our sponsors for providing such a great way to end a conference day.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kP7ckIEo7IU/UYLEyRBpYqI/AAAAAAAAA4o/PaT-skA9ZSM/s1600/cruise-04.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="132" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kP7ckIEo7IU/UYLEyRBpYqI/AAAAAAAAA4o/PaT-skA9ZSM/s200/cruise-04.jpg" width="200" />&lt;/a>As some have pointed out, the only down-side of the dinner was that the social part fell a bit short, since most people haven't left their tables for the duration of the trip (I have, but I was taking the pictures!), which hindered a bit the &lt;i>social&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;part of the event.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />But, to be honest, that wasn't so bad, since most (I really mean &lt;i>most&lt;/i>) of the people decided to walk to the river, spending no less than 1 hour together, enjoying the scenery and each others company.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />&lt;/b>&lt;b>Prize Draw and&amp;nbsp;Wrapping Up&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />&lt;/b>&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dz9N87WcuhY/UYLFOHEbFuI/AAAAAAAAA6E/tL64Syw9xIg/s1600/prize-draw.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dz9N87WcuhY/UYLFOHEbFuI/AAAAAAAAA6E/tL64Syw9xIg/s200/prize-draw.jpg" width="183" />&lt;/a>After the last session, just before the event ended, a great Parot headphone was delivered to Ahmed, who won the lottery.&lt;br />&lt;br />From my point of view, this was a very successful event, proof that Europe also has interesting LLVM engineering going on. It's also getting in shape with what people hope to find at these events, following the acceptance rates of talks and organization issues.&lt;br />&lt;br />With offers to help all over Europe (and beyond!), I wonder where the next EuroLLVM will be... But one thing I know: it's going to be great! :-)</description></item><item><title>Clang support for C++11 and beyond</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/04/clang-support-for-c11-and-beyond.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2013 07:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/04/clang-support-for-c11-and-beyond.html</guid><description>
As of &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project?view=revision&amp;amp;revision=179861">r179861&lt;/a>, Clang implements the &lt;b>entirety&lt;/b> of the C++11 language standard. The following features have been implemented since the release of Clang 3.2, along with our plans for "C++1y".&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;h3>Support for &lt;tt>[[attributes]]&lt;/tt>&lt;/h3>C++11's &lt;tt>[[attribute]]&lt;/tt> syntax is now fully supported, including support for the standard &lt;tt>[[noreturn]]&lt;/tt> and &lt;tt>[[carries_dependency]]&lt;/tt> attributes (although &lt;tt>[[carries_dependency]]&lt;/tt> does not provide improved code generation). This allows non-returning functions to be written with a standard syntax: &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>[[noreturn]] void foo() {&lt;br /> while (true) do_something();&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;pre>&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Just like &lt;tt>__attribute__((noreturn))&lt;/tt>, Clang will warn you if you use this attribute on a function which can return, and will optimize callers on the assumption that the function does not return. Unlike &lt;tt>__attribute__((noreturn))&lt;/tt>, &lt;tt>[[noreturn]]&lt;/tt> is never part of a function's type. &lt;br />&lt;br />As with g++'s implementation, &lt;tt>__attribute__((foo))&lt;/tt> attributes which are supported by g++ can be written as &lt;tt>[[gnu::foo]]&lt;/tt>. Clang-specific &lt;tt>__attribute__((...))&lt;/tt>s are not available through this syntax (patches to add &lt;tt>[[clang::...]]&lt;/tt> attribute names are welcome).&lt;br />&lt;br />Clang also now provides complete support for C++11's almost-attribute &lt;tt>alignas(...)&lt;/tt>. &lt;br />&lt;h3>Inheriting constructors&lt;/h3>Clang now supports C++11's inheriting constructor syntax, which provides a simple mechanism to re-export all the constructors from a base class, other than default constructors, or constructors which would be copy or move constructors for either the base or derived class. Example: &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>struct Base {&lt;br /> Base(); // default constructor, not inherited&lt;br /> Base(int, char);&lt;br /> template&amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt; Base(T &amp;amp;x);&lt;br />};&lt;br />struct Derived : Base {&lt;br /> using Base::Base;&lt;br />};&lt;br />Derived f(1, 'x');&lt;br />Derived d("foo"); // ok, calls inheriting constructor template&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;h3>&lt;tt>thread_local&lt;/tt> variables&lt;/h3>Clang now supports C++11's &lt;tt>thread_local&lt;/tt> keyword, including dynamic initialization and destruction of thread-local objects. Dynamic destruction requires a C++ runtime library which provides &lt;tt>__cxa_thread_atexit&lt;/tt>, which is currently only provided by the g++4.8 C++ runtime library. &lt;br />&lt;h2>C++1y&lt;/h2>With C++11 out of the door, what's next? The C++ standardization committee voted yesterday to create the first Committee Draft for C++1y (which will very likely be C++14). Since this is only the first draft, there will probably be many minor changes before C++1y is done, but the rough feature set is unlikely to change much. This new language standard includes: &lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>Generalized lambdas, allowing a templated call operator and arbitrary captures: &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>auto apply = [v(21)] (auto &amp;amp;&amp;amp;fn) { fn(v); };&lt;br />apply([] (int &amp;amp;n) { n += 21; });&lt;br />apply([] (int n) { std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; n; });&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;/li>&lt;li>Return type deduction for (non-lambda) functions: &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>auto fn(int n) { return something(n); }&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;/li>&lt;li>A more powerful &lt;tt>constexpr&lt;/tt> feature, allowing variable mutation and loops: &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;/pre>&lt;pre>constexpr auto len(const char *str) {&lt;br /> int k = 0;&lt;br /> while (*str++) ++k;&lt;br /> return k;&lt;br />}&lt;br />static_assert(len("foo") == 3, "hooray");&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>The improved &lt;tt>constexpr&lt;/tt> feature comes with a backwards-compatibility cost, however. In order to support variable mutation for user-defined types, those types need to have &lt;tt>constexpr&lt;/tt> member functions which are not &lt;tt>const&lt;/tt>, so the C++11 rule which made &lt;tt>constexpr&lt;/tt> member functions implicitly &lt;tt>const&lt;/tt> has been removed. This means that you will need to make the &lt;tt>const&lt;/tt> explicit if you were previously relying on this shorthand. Rewrite: &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;/pre>&lt;pre>struct S {&lt;br /> int n;&lt;br /> constexpr int get() { return n; }&lt;br />};&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />... as ... &lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;/pre>&lt;pre>struct S {&lt;br /> int n;&lt;br /> constexpr int get() const { return n; }&lt;br />};&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />... and your code will work in both C++11 and C++14. Clang already has a warning for code which is relying on the implicit &lt;tt>const&lt;/tt> rule, and will fix it for you if you run &lt;tt>clang -fixit&lt;/tt>. Other compilers supporting C++11 &lt;tt>constexpr&lt;/tt>&amp;nbsp;are expected to start providing similar warnings soon. &lt;br />&lt;br />Several of the new features were prototyped in Clang prior to standardization, and we expect implementations of those to land in Clang SVN over the coming weeks. See the &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html">Clang C++ status page&lt;/a> for the latest details on C++1y features and Clang's support for them. The implemented features can be enabled with the &lt;tt>-std=c++1y&lt;/tt> command-line flag. &lt;br />&lt;br />If you find bugs in the C++11 support, please report them on &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/bugs">our bug tracker&lt;/a>.

Since the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xXfpLPxXIlp3pUpASXC547sQFF-vvHhnQkRBogM9wX0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">design document&lt;/a> for cpp11-migrate, the C++11 migrator tool, was first proposed in &lt;a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=MTI0Mzc" target="_blank">early December 2012&lt;/a> development has been making steady progress. In this article I'll talk about what's been implemented in cpp11-migrate so far, what's coming up, and how you can get involved.&lt;br />&lt;br />The purpose of the C++11 Migrator is to do source-to-source translation to migrate existing C++ code to use C++11 features to enhance maintainability, readability, runtime performance, and compile-time performance. Development is still early and transforms fall mostly into the first two categories. The migrator is based on Clang's &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html" target="_blank">LibTooling&lt;/a> and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibASTMatchers.html" target="_blank">AST Matching library&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />Most of the development so far has been carried out by a small core group at Intel. Our focus so far has been to set up project infrastructure and testing, implement a few basic transforms, and make sure those transforms work well. Our aim is to make this tool useful to the community so we're always listening for transform ideas and feedback.&lt;br />&lt;h2>&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>How to Get cpp11-migrate&lt;/h2>cpp11-migrate is located in the Extra Clang Tools repository. To build cpp11-migrate, you will need the LLVM and Clang sources as well. Follow the directions in Clang's &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html" target="_blank">Getting Started instructions&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;making sure to perform the optional step of checking out the Extra Clang Tools repository. Once checked out into the correct directory the build system, after a reconfiguration, will automatically include the extra Clang tools as part of the next full build. If you're using the CMake build system, you can build just cpp11-migrate with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">cpp11-migrate&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"> target&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">.&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;The &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">check-clang-tools&lt;/span> target provided by CMake will run all regression tests for extra Clang tools, including cpp11-migrate.&lt;br />&lt;h2>The Transforms So Far&lt;/h2>The C++11 Migrator currently supports four features of C++11:&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>Range-based for loops&lt;/li>&lt;li>The &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">nullptr&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>literal for null pointers&lt;/li>&lt;li>The &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">auto&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"> &lt;/span>type specifier&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">override&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"> &lt;/span>virtual specifier&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;span style="font-size: large;">The range-based for-loop transform&lt;/span> once existed as a stand-alone tool called &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">loop-convert&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;">&amp;nbsp;contributed by Sam Panzer. When development on more transforms started, the idea became to pull all transforms under the jurisdiction of a single tool and &lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">cpp11-migrate&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"> was born. The range-based for-loop transform replaces for-loops used in one of the following three common situations:&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>Loops over containers using iterators&lt;/li>&lt;div style="text-indent: 0;

We've set up a continuous integration server to build and run cpp11-migrate on two projects so far and have plans for at least three more.

Real code from varying projects often reveals code expressions not accounted for in the development and unit testing of the transforms. Every time a bug found from transforming these projects gets fixed, new test cases are added to the regression test suite and the migrator becomes more robust.&lt;br />&lt;h2>Future Work&lt;/h2>&lt;div>Fixing bugs found by migrating real code is of high priority right now since we want a good user experience for as many people as we can as soon as possible. Adding more transforms is another priority and those transforms with the most interest from the community will come first. Currently at the top of the list are:&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;ol>&lt;li>Use the standard library instead of TR1&lt;/li>&lt;li>Replace use of the deprecated &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">auto_ptr&lt;/span> class.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>In addition to fixing bugs and adding transforms, there are also more general&amp;nbsp;improvements to consider. One such improvement we're making progress on is to remove the restriction that only source files are transformed and not any of the headers they include. The restriction has been in place until now because the migrator needs to know which headers are safe to transform. System headers and third-party library headers clearly shouldn't be touched.&lt;/div>&lt;h2>Get Involved!&lt;/h2>&lt;div>If you want to get involved, the first thing you can do is try out cpp11-migrate on your code.

&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&lt;br />Static analysis is a method of computer program debugging that is done by examining the code without executing the program. The process provides an understanding of the code structure, can help to ensure that the code adheres to industry standards, and can find bugs not easy to detect.&lt;br />&lt;br />To develop a C / C++ static analysis tool, a parser is needed to parse the source code. C++ is a very powerful language but its syntax is a little bit complicated, what makes the parser not easy to develop.&lt;br />&lt;br />When we began the development of &lt;a href="http://www.cppdepend.com/">CppDepend &lt;/a>about four years ago we needed a reliable C / C++ parser. &amp;nbsp;At that time, Clang was an option but was not widely used and we didn’t know if it would ultimately develop into a fully-featured compiler frontend.&lt;br />&lt;br />Last year, for the&amp;nbsp;major release of CppDepend 3.0,&amp;nbsp;we re-evaluated our C / C++ parser with a goal of getting more reliable results. &amp;nbsp;We checked Clang to see where its evolution went and were very surprised that it now implements virtually all C++'11 features and became very popular. &amp;nbsp;Clang now provide solid infrastructure to write tools that need syntactic and semantic information about a program.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;br />Clang is designed to be modular, and like other compilers it has three phases: &lt;br />&lt;ul style="text-align: left;">&lt;li>The front end that parses source code, checking it for errors, and builds a language-specific Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent the input code.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The optimizer: its goal is to do some optimization on the AST generated by the front end.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The back end: generates the final code to be executed by the machine, it depends of the target architecture.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WDcl2mtJ8Do/UWnL-S-FgiI/AAAAAAAAAn0/3LTWx4a32XY/s1600/clang.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WDcl2mtJ8Do/UWnL-S-FgiI/AAAAAAAAAn0/3LTWx4a32XY/s1600/clang.gif" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;br />In our case we needed only to use the front end parser, and we use the generated AST. For that we added our custom&amp;nbsp;ASTFrontEndAction.&lt;br />Each ASTFrontEndAction create one or many ASTConsumer as shown by the following dependency gaph:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Fvq7jfoaiwY/UWnTLIOexFI/AAAAAAAAAoE/86hDIkA9OaQ/s1600/clang2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Fvq7jfoaiwY/UWnTLIOexFI/AAAAAAAAAoE/86hDIkA9OaQ/s1600/clang2.png" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;br />ASTConsumer is an abstract class, and we have to implement our AST consumer for our specific needs. And to do that we had take a look at the implementation of the existing AST Consumers to understand how they works, and here are all the classes inheriting from ASTConsumer:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3I8Luf_nK8Y/UWnVKzU3ooI/AAAAAAAAAoQ/aBd4RBORAjM/s1600/clang3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3I8Luf_nK8Y/UWnVKzU3ooI/AAAAAAAAAoQ/aBd4RBORAjM/s1600/clang3.png" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;br />And we took &amp;nbsp;ASTPrinter and ASTDumpXML as examples to understand how to implements our specific AST consumer.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;Thanks to all the developers behind LLVM and Clang for their big efforts to deliver a powerful compiler, and to thank all open source C / C++ contributors, we are giving you a CppDepend "Pro license" for free. &amp;nbsp;CppDepend can be used to analyze a code base in order to:&lt;br />&lt;br />•&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>Improve the code base quality.&lt;br />•&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>Help new contributors to understand the existing code base.&lt;br />•&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>Automate the code review to be sure that all the coding rules specified by the manager are satisfied.&lt;br />•&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>Generate custom reports for documentation purpose.&lt;br />&lt;br />To get your CppDepend Pro license, you can just send us a mail at support@cppdepend.com with the following infos:&lt;br />&lt;br />•&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>Name of the contributor.&lt;br />•&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span>Link to the patches that you have contributed.&lt;br />&lt;br />Thanks!&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>LLVM Recipient of the 2012 ACM System Software Award</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/04/llvm-recipient-of-2012-acm-system.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2013 07:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/04/llvm-recipient-of-2012-acm-system.html</guid><description>

There are "Thread Sanitizer" (TSan), "Undefined Behavior Sanitizer" (UBSan), and others. There's an integer overflow sanitizer which is called IOC coming in the 3.3 release of clang. The documentation for UBSan can be found &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html">on the LLVM site&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />I have been looking at the results of running the libc++ test suite with UBSan enabled. Even if you're not interested in libc++ specifically, this post can be a useful introduction to useful Clang bug detectors, and shows several classes of problems they can find. &lt;br />&lt;h3>&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>&lt;h3>The mechanics&lt;/h3>Like ASan, UBSan is a compiler pass and a custom runtime library. You enable this by passing &lt;code>-fsanitize=undefined&lt;/code> to the compiler and linker. I ran the libc++ test suite like this:&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;code>&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;pre>&lt;code>cd $LLVM/libcxx/test&lt;br />CC=/path/to/tot/clang OPTIONS="--std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -fsanitize=undefined" ./testit&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Unfortunately, this failed; working with unreleased compilers and libraries, I needed updated versions of both libc++.dylib and libc++abi.dylib. So I built those from sources, and then used &lt;code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH&lt;/code> to make sure that the test program used the libraries that I'd just built. (I didn't want to replace the ones in /usr/lib, because lots of things in the system depend on them)&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;code>&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;pre>&lt;code>cd $LLVM/libcxx/test&lt;br />DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LLVM/libcxx/lib:$LLVM/libcxxabi/lib CC=/path/to/tot/clang OPTIONS="-std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -fsanitize=undefined -L $LLVM/libcxxabi/lib -lc++abi" ./testit&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;br />where, as before "/path/to/tot/clang" is the clang that I just built from source, and $LLVM is where I've checked out the various parts of LLVM from Subversion. &lt;br />&lt;h3>The results&lt;/h3>And the tests were off and running. In the last article, I noted that these tests take about 30 minutes to run on my MacBook Pro. The ASan tests took about 90 minutes. I was pleasantly surprised when the UBSan tests finished in about 42 minutes, or about 40% slower than the baseline tests. There were 12 tests (out of more than 4800) that failed under normal circumstances. Using UBSan, 49 tests failed, and there were about 48,463 different runtime errors reported by UBSan. &lt;br />&lt;h4>The failing tests&lt;/h4>Of the 37 tests that failed under UBSan, 34 of them were aborted because of &lt;code>uncaught exception of type XXXX&lt;/code>, where XXX was from the standard library (&lt;code>std::out_of_range&lt;/code>, for example). This is caused by a mismatch between libc++ and libc++abi, specifically by the fact that both my custom-built libc++ and my custom-built libc++abi contained typeinfo records for some of the standard exception classes. Getting this right and getting all the bits of the test infrastructure to use the right libraries turned into a big mess very quickly, and I still don't have a good solution here.&lt;br />&lt;br />However, I was able to convince myself that these failures were not the result of a bug in either libc++, the test suite or UBSan.&lt;br />&lt;br />The other three failures were in the &lt;code>std::thread&lt;/code> test suite. When I investigated, it turned out that there was a race condition in some of the thread tests. &lt;em>A race condition? In threading code? Inconceivable!&lt;/em>&lt;br />&lt;br />Apparently the runtime environment under UBSan was different enough to trigger the (latent) race condition in these three tests. Looking at the test suite, I found the same race condition in 10 other tests as well. I committed revision 178029 to fix this in all 13 tests. &lt;br />&lt;h4>The error messages&lt;/h4>48K errors! I can't look at 48K error messages; so I decided to bin them.&lt;br />&lt;br />There were 37,675 messages of the form: &lt;code>0x000106ae3fff: runtime error: value inf is outside the range of representable values of type 'xxxx'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/code>where "xxxx" could be "double" or "float" (this also included "-inf" as well)&lt;br />&lt;br />and 10,693 messages of the form: &lt;code>0x000101a8f244: runtime error: value nan is outside the range of representable values of type 'xxxx';&lt;/code>&amp;nbsp;where "xxxx" could be "double" or "float".&lt;br />&lt;br />There were 52 messages of the form: &amp;nbsp;&lt;code>what.pass.cpp:24:9: runtime error: member call on address 0x7fff5e8f48d0 which does not point to an object of type 'std::logic_error'.&lt;/code>&lt;br />&lt;br />There were 29 messages like this: &amp;nbsp;&lt;code>eval.pass.cpp:180:14: runtime error: division by zero&lt;/code>&lt;br />&lt;br />There were 6 messages like this: &lt;code>/Sources/LLVM/libcxx/include/memory:3163:25 runtime error: load of misaligned address 0x7fff569a85c6 for type 'const unsigned long', which requires 8 byte alignment&lt;/code>&lt;br />&lt;br />There were 5 messages like this: &lt;code>0x0001037a329e: runtime error: load of value 4294967294, which is not a valid value for type 'std::regex_constants::match_flag_type'&lt;/code>&lt;br />&lt;br />There were 2 messages like this: &lt;code>/Sources/LLVM/libcxx/include/locale:3361:48: runtime error: index 40 out of bounds for type 'char_type [10]'&lt;/code>&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;There was one message like this: &lt;code>runtime error: load of value 64, which is not a valid value for type 'bool'&lt;/code>&lt;br />&lt;br />The first thing that I noticed is that sometimes UBSan will give you file and line number, and otherwise just a hex address. The file and line number is incredibly useful for tracking stuff down. &lt;br />&lt;h4>The Analysis&lt;/h4>Working from the bottom up:&lt;br />&lt;br />The &lt;code>load of value 64, which is not a valid value for type 'bool'&lt;/code> message came out of one of the atomics tests, where it is trying to clear and set an atomic flag that has been default constructed. I don't know what the correct behavior is here; I'm still looking at this one.&lt;br />&lt;br />The &lt;code>index 40 out of bounds for type 'char_type [10]'&lt;/code> errors came from the money formatting tests in libc++, and were failing only on "wide string" versions of the tests; i.e, with two (or four) byte characters. The offending line turned out to be:&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;code>*__nc = __src[find(__atoms, __atoms+sizeof(__atoms), *__w) - __atoms];&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>and the problem was that sizeof(__atoms) was assumed to be the same as the number of entries in that array. Perfectly fine for character arrays, not so fine for wide character arrays. Fixed in revision 177694. &lt;br />&lt;br />The &lt;code>load of value 4294967294, which is not a valid value for type 'std::regex_constants::match_flag_type'&lt;/code> errors turned out to be simple to fix as well, once we decided what the right fix was.&lt;br />&lt;br />This turned out to be complicated, because it involved a close reading of the standards document. The problem was that &lt;code>match_flag_type&lt;/code> was an enum, emulating a bitmask. The type also had an &lt;code>operator ~()&lt;/code>, which flipped all the bits in the type. But since the type was implemented as an enum, it had an underlying integer type that it was represented as, and the &lt;code>operator ~&lt;/code> just flipped all the bits. This led to values that UBSan didn't like. A large discussion followed, with sentiments like "does it matter" and "can any code actually tell", and so on. Eventually, I just changed the &lt;code>operator ~&lt;/code> to only flip the bits that are valid in the enumeration. Fixed in revision 177693.&lt;br />&lt;br />The &lt;code>load of misaligned address 0x7fff569a85c6 for type 'const unsigned long', which requires 8 byte alignment&lt;/code> were in the hashing code for strings. They are a performance optimization, and I haven't tried to touch them. Whatever changes are made here will have to be done very carefully, since this will affect the performance of all the associative containers.&lt;br />&lt;br />The "division by zero" messages were in three different tests. There were 3 of them in the numeric limits tests, and they were there on purpose. There were 2 of them in the complex number tests, and they were also on purpose. The other 24 of them were in the random number test suite, where the tests were generating a bunch of random numbers (using various distributions) and checking to see that the mean, variance, standard deviation, skew, etc, were all what the programmer expected. The problem is in the last measurement: skew. It is some calculated value divided by the variance. If the variance is zero, then the skew should be infinity. Many of the tests in the random number suite are testing "edge cases" of the random number generators, and some of these edge cases will produce a sequence where all the numbers are the same (and thus, the variance == 0). We solved this by commenting out the calculation of the skew for these degenerate cases, and leaving a comment in the test source file. Howard fixed this in revision 177826.&lt;br />&lt;br />The &lt;code>runtime error: member call on address 0x7fff5e8f48d0 which does not point to an object of type 'std::logic_error'&lt;/code> messages, as it turned out, were due to a bug in UBSan.&lt;br />&lt;br />I'm just getting started on the &lt;code>inf&lt;/code>/&lt;code>-inf&lt;/code>/&lt;code>nan&lt;/code> messages (about 48K of those). Most of these come from the complex number regression tests. Since this is a test suite for a library that implements a bunch of numeric routines, a lot of the tests actually do generate and use nan/inf, so I expect that many of these will be "false positives". Richard Smith has pointed out:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;blockquote>The C++ standard’s treatment of Inf and NaN values is highly underspecified, so for the most part it’s not clear what has defined behavior and what does not.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote>&lt;blockquote>Anyway… I’m updating UBSan to suppress the diagnostics for conversions of ‘Inf’ and ‘NaN’ between floating-point types, and will probably split out a separate flag for finite overflow in conversions to floating-point types, so that users can turn it off as needed. I think that’s the right compromise for the time being. &lt;/blockquote>&lt;h4>Conclusions&lt;/h4>This exercise, while not completed, has already turned up a set of bugs in the libc++ test suite, as well as a bug in libc++ and some undefined behavior in libc++. There's more to look at here, but I think this was a good exercise. There's kind of a mismatch of expectations here, especially in the complex and numeric test suites, because UBSan is looking for nan/inf/-inf and the libc++ test code is deliberately generating them.&lt;br />&lt;br />Thanks to Howard Hinnant for his patience and explanations about the C++ standard and libc++ and the libc++ test suite, and to Richard Smith for his help with UBSan and interpreting the C++ standard.</description></item><item><title>Testing libc++ with Address Sanitizer</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/03/testing-libc-with-address-sanitizer.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2013 14:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/03/testing-libc-with-address-sanitizer.html</guid><description>
&lt;i>[This article is re-posted in a slightly expanded form &lt;a href="http://cplusplusmusings.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/testing-libc-with-address-sanitizer/">from Marshall's blog&lt;/a>]&lt;/i>&lt;br />I've been running the libc++ tests off and on for a while. It's a quite extensive test suite, but I wondered if there were any bugs that the test suite was not uncovering. In the upcoming clang 3.3, there is a new feature named &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html">Address Sanitizer&lt;/a> which inserts a bunch of runtime checks into your executable to see if there are any "out of bounds" reads and writes to memory.&lt;br />In the back of my head, I've always thought that it would be nice to be able to say that libc++ was "ASan clean" (i.e, passed all of the test suite when running with Address Sanitizer).&lt;br />So I decided to do that.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> [ All of this work was done on Mac OS X 10.8.2/3 ] &lt;h3> How to run the tests:&lt;/h3>There's a script for running the tests. It's called &lt;code>testit&lt;/code>.&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;code> $ cd $LLVM/libcxx/test ; ./testit&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;pre>&lt;code>&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>where $LLVM/libcxx is where libc++ is checked out. This takes about 30 minutes to run. Without Address Sanitizer, libc++ fails 12 out of the 4348 tests on my system. &lt;h3>Running the tests with Address Sanitizer&lt;/h3>&lt;pre>&lt;code> $ cd $LLVM/libcxx/test ; CC=/path/to/tot/clang++ OPTIONS= "-std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -fsanitize=address" ./testit&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;em>Note: the default options are "-std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++", that's what you get if you don't specify anything&lt;/em>.This takes about 92 minutes; just a bit more than three times as long. With Address Sanitizer, libc++ fails 54 tests (again, out of 4348)&lt;br />&lt;br />What are the failures?&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>In 11 tests, Address Sanitizer detected a one-byte write outside a heap block. All of these involve iostreams. I created a small test program that ASan also fires on, and sent it to Howard Hinnant (who wrote most of libc++), and he found a place where he was allocating a zero-byte buffer by mistake. One bug, multiple failures. He fixed this in revision &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project?rev=177452&amp;amp;view=rev">177452&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>&lt;li>2 tests for std::random were failing. This turned out to be an off-by-one error in the test code, not in libc++. I fixed these in revisions &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project?rev=177355&amp;amp;view=rev">177355&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project?rev=177464&amp;amp;view=rev">177464&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Address Sanitizer detected memory allocations failing in 4 cases. This is expected, since some of the tests are testing the memory allocation system of libc++. However, it appears that ASan does not call the user-supplied &lt;code>new_handler&lt;/code> when memory allocation fails (and may not throw &lt;code>std::bad_alloc&lt;/code>, ether). I have filed &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=15544">PR15544&lt;/a> to track this issue.&lt;/li>&lt;li>25 cases are failing where the program is failing to load, due to a missing symbol. This is most commonly &lt;code>std::__1::__get_sp_mut(void const *)&lt;/code>, but there are a couple others. Howard says that this was added to libc++ after 10.8 shipped, so it's not in the dylib in /usr/lib. If the tests are run with a copy of libc++ built from source, they pass.&lt;/li>&lt;li>There are the 12 cases that were failing before enabling Address Sanitizer.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Once Howard and I fixed the random tests and the bug in the iostreams code, I re-ran the tests using a recently build libc++.dylib.&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;code> $ cd $LLVM/libcxx/test ; DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LLVM/libcxx/lib CC=/path/to/tot/clang++ OPTIONS= "-std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -fsanitize=address" ./testit&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>This gave us 16 failures: &lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>The 4 failures that have to do with memory allocation failures.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The 12 failures that we started with.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&lt;h4>Conclusion&lt;/h4>I'm glad to see that there were so few problems in the libc++ code. It's a fundamental building block for applications on Mac OS X (and, as llvm becomes more popular, other systems). And now it's better than it was when we started this exercise.However, we did find a couple bugs in the test suite, and one heap-smashing bug in libc++. We also found a limitation in Address Sanitizer, too - which the developers are working on addressing.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br /></description></item><item><title>Instruction Relationship Framework in LLVM</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/03/instruction-relationship-framework-in.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2013 13:42:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2013/03/instruction-relationship-framework-in.html</guid><description>
The article provides an overview of the new Relationship framework of TableGen. This TableGen feature is used to describe user defined relationships between instructions. It was added to LLVM in October 2012. &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a> &lt;!-- ======================================================================= -->&lt;h3 id="Motivation">Motivation:&lt;/h3>&lt;!-- ======================================================================= --> The motivation for this feature stemmed from the Hexagon backend. Much like other processors, Hexagon provides multiple variations for many instructions. It is a common requirement in machine instruction passes to switch between various formats of the same instruction. For example, consider an &lt;tt>Add&lt;/tt> instruction with predicated true (&lt;tt>Add_pt&lt;/tt>) and predicated false (&lt;tt>Add_pf&lt;/tt>) forms. Let's assume that a non-predicated &lt;tt>Add&lt;/tt> instruction is selected during target lowering. However, during if-conversion, the optimization pass might decide to change the non-predicated &lt;tt>Add&lt;/tt> into the predicated true &lt;tt>Add_pt&lt;/tt> form. These transformations require a framework to relate non-predicated forms to the respective predicated forms. In the absence of such a framework, this transformation is typically achieved using large switch cases. There are many deficiencies in using a switch case based approach. The manual implementation of switch case clauses requires a very high maintenance cost. It also results in lost optimization opportunities due to incomplete implementation of switch cases. The lack of a relationship model resulted in around 15% of Hexagon backend code dedicated to switch cases with several of those functions growing to over thousands of lines of code.&lt;br />&lt;br />This problem inspired us to explore some alternatives. We started to look for a framework that was easy to maintain, flexible, scalable, and less error prone. After some initial discussions and brainstorming in the Hexagon group, we decided to modify TableGen to express instruction relations. The initial design was submitted to the LLVM-dev mailing list for review. Jakob Stoklund gave valuable suggestions and helped with the design of the relationship framework. The idea was to add a query language that can be used to define different kind of relationships between instructions. TableGen was extended to parse relationship models. It uses the information to construct tables which are queried to determine new opcodes corresponding to a relationship. The Hexagon backend relies heavily on the relationship framework and it has significantly improved the code quality of our target.&lt;br />&lt;br />Before getting into the implementation details, let's consider an API that takes an instruction opcode as input and returns its predicated true/false form. We'll first look at the switch-case based solution and then compare it with the relationship based implementation. &lt;br \>&lt;div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff;">&lt;pre style="line-height: 150%;">&lt;br />&lt;br />short getPredicatedTrue(short opcode) {&lt;br />switch (opcode) {&lt;br />default:&lt;br /> return -1;&lt;br />case Hexagon::Add:&lt;br /> return Hexagon::Add_pt;&lt;br />case Hexagon::Sub:&lt;br /> return Hexagon::Sub_pt;&lt;br />case Hexagon::And:&lt;br /> return Hexagon::And_pt;&lt;br />case Hexagon::Or:&lt;br /> return Hexagon::Or_pt;&lt;br />case ... :&lt;br /> return ...&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />short getPredicatedFalse(short opcode) {&lt;br />switch (opcode) {&lt;br />default:&lt;br /> return -1;&lt;br />case Hexagon::Add:&lt;br /> return Hexagon::Add_pf;&lt;br />case Hexagon::Sub:&lt;br /> return Hexagon::Sub_pf;&lt;br />case Hexagon::And:&lt;br /> return Hexagon::And_pf;&lt;br />case Hexagon::Or:&lt;br /> return Hexagon::Or_pf;&lt;br />case ... :&lt;br /> return ...&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />short getPredicatedOpcode(short opcode, bool predSense) {&lt;br />return predSense ? getPredicatedTrue(opcode)&lt;br /> : getPredicatedFlase(opcode);&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;/div> The switch-case based approach becomes quite unwieldy because of the large number of cases. Also, it requires continuous maintenance as new instructions are added. The problem becomes more demanding when an instruction has multiple relations since each of these APIs must be updated.&lt;br />&lt;br />The relationship framework offers a very systematic solution to this problem. It requires instructions to model their attributes and categorize their groups. For instance, a field called 'PredSense' can be used to record whether an instruction is predicated or not and its sense of predication. Each instruction in the group has to be unique such that no two instructions can share all the same attributes. There must be at least one field with different value. The instruction groups are modeled by assigning a common base name to all the instructions in the group. One of the biggest advantages of this approach is that, by modeling these attributes and groups once, we can define multiple relationships with very little effort.&lt;br />&lt;br />With the relationship framework, the &lt;tt>getPredicatedOpcode&lt;/tt> API can be implemented as below: &lt;br />&lt;div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff;">&lt;pre style="line-height: 150%;">&lt;br />&lt;br />short getPredicatedOpcode(short opcode, bool predSense) {&lt;br />return predSense ? getPredicated(opcode, PredSenseTrue)&lt;br /> : getPredicated(opcode, PredSenseFalse);&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>Here, &lt;tt>getPredicated()&lt;/tt> function is automatically generated by the relationship framework. It performs a query into the corresponding relationship table, also generated by the framework, and returns the matching predicated opcode if found.&lt;br /> &lt;!-- ======================================================================= -->&lt;h3 id="architecture">Architecture:&lt;/h3>&lt;!-- ======================================================================= --> The entire framework is driven by a class called &lt;tt>InstrMapping&lt;/tt>. The TableGen back-end has been extended to include a new parser for the relationship models implemented using &lt;tt>InstrMapping&lt;/tt> class. Any relationship model must derive from this class and assign all the class members to the appropriate values. This is how the class looks like: &lt;br \>&lt;div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff;">&lt;pre style="line-height: 150%;">&lt;br />&lt;br />class InstrMapping {&lt;br /> // Used to reduce search space only to the instructions using this relation model&lt;br /> string FilterClass;&lt;br />&lt;br /> // List of fields/attributes that should be same for all the instructions in&lt;br /> // a row of the relation table. Think of this as a set of properties shared&lt;br /> // by all the instructions related by this relationship.&lt;br /> list&lt;string> RowFields = [];&lt;br /> // List of fields/attributes that are same for all the instructions&lt;br /> // in a column of the relation table.&lt;br /> list&lt;string> ColFields = [];&lt;br />&lt;br /> // Values for the fields/attributes listed in 'ColFields' corresponding to&lt;br /> // the key instruction. This is the instruction that will be transformed&lt;br /> // using this relation model.&lt;br /> list&lt;string> KeyCol = [];&lt;br />&lt;br /> // List of values for the fields/attributes listed in 'ColFields', one for&lt;br /> // each column in the relation table. These are the instructions a key&lt;br /> // instruction will be transformed into.&lt;br /> list&lt;list string=""> &amp;gt; ValueCols = [];&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/list>&lt;/string>&lt;/string>&lt;/string>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>Now, let's revisit the &lt;tt>getPredicated&lt;/tt> API. As mentioned earlier, this function can be auto-generated by the relationship framework. It requires us to define a relationship model that can relate non-predicated instructions with their predicated forms: &lt;br \>&lt;div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff;">&lt;pre style="line-height: 150%;">&lt;br />&lt;br />def getPredicated : InstrMapping {&lt;br /> // Choose a FilterClass that is used as a base class for all the instructions modeling&lt;br /> // this relationship. This is done to reduce the search space only to these set of instructions.&lt;br /> let FilterClass = "PredRel";&lt;br />&lt;br /> // Instructions with same values for all the fields in RowFields form a row in the resulting&lt;br /> // relation table.&lt;br /> // For example, if we want to relate 'Add' (non-predicated) with 'Add_pt'&lt;br /> // (predicated true) and 'Add_pf' (predicated false), then all 3&lt;br /> // instructions need to have a common base name, i.e., same value for BaseOpcode here. It can be &lt;br /> // any unique value (Ex: XYZ) and should not be shared with any other instruction not related to 'Add'.&lt;br /> let RowFields = ["BaseOpcode"];&lt;br />&lt;br /> // List of attributes that can be used to define key and column instructions for a relation.&lt;br /> // Here, key instruction is passed as an argument to the function used for querying relation tables.&lt;br /> // Column instructions are the instructions they (key) can transform into.&lt;br /> //&lt;br /> // Here, we choose 'PredSense' as ColFields since this is the unique attribute of the key&lt;br /> // (non-predicated) and column (true/false) instructions involved in this relationship model.&lt;br /> let ColFields = ["PredSense"];&lt;br />&lt;br /> // The key column contains non-predicated instructions.&lt;br /> let KeyCol = ["none"];&lt;br />&lt;br /> // Two value columns - first column contains instructions with PredSense=true while the second&lt;br /> // column has instructions with PredSense=false.&lt;br /> let ValueCols = [["true"], ["false"]];&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>This relationship model is processed and the information is used to construct a table along with the API to query. All this is emitted in the &lt;tt>XXXInstrInfo.inc&lt;/tt> file. However, with the changes made so far, we may end up with an empty relation table since we haven't defined &lt;tt>PredSense&lt;/tt> and &lt;tt>BaseOpcode&lt;/tt> for any of the instructions yet. &lt;br \>&lt;div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff;">&lt;pre style="line-height: 150%;">&lt;br />&lt;br />multiclass ALU32_Pred&lt;string bit="" mnemonic="" prednot=""> {&lt;br /> let &lt;span style="color: royalblue; font-weight: bold;">PredSense = !if(PredNot, "false", "true")&lt;/span>, isPredicated = 1 in&lt;br /> def NAME : ALU32_rr&amp;lt;(outs IntRegs:$dst),&lt;br /> (ins PredRegs:$src1, IntRegs:$src2, IntRegs: $src3),&lt;br /> !if(PredNot, "if (!$src1)", "if ($src1)")#&lt;br /> " $dst = "#mnemonic#"($src2, $src3)",&lt;br /> []&amp;gt;;&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />multiclass ALU32_base&lt;string baseop="" mnemonic="" opnode="" sdnode="" string=""> {&lt;br /> let &lt;span style="color: royalblue; font-weight: bold;">BaseOpcode = BaseOp&lt;/span> in {&lt;br /> let isPredicable = 1 in&lt;br /> def NAME : ALU32_rr&amp;lt;(outs IntRegs:$dst),&lt;br /> (ins IntRegs:$src1, IntRegs:$src2),&lt;br /> "$dst = "#mnemonic#"($src1, $src2)",&lt;br /> [(set (i32 IntRegs:$dst), (OpNode (i32 IntRegs:$src1),&lt;br /> (i32 IntRegs:$src2)))]&amp;gt;;&lt;br />&lt;br /> defm pt : ALU32_Pred&lt;mnemonic 0="">; // Predicate true&lt;br /> defm pf : ALU32_Pred&lt;mnemonic 1="">; // Predicate false&lt;br /> }&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />let isCommutable = 1 in {&lt;br /> defm Add : ALU32_base&amp;lt;"add", "ADD", add&amp;gt;, &lt;span style="color: royalblue; font-weight: bold;">PredRel&lt;/span>;&lt;br /> defm And : ALU32_base&amp;lt;"and", "AND", and&amp;gt;, &lt;span style="color: royalblue; font-weight: bold;">PredRel&lt;/span>;&lt;br /> defm Xor: ALU32_base&amp;lt;"xor", "XOR", xor&amp;gt;, &lt;span style="color: royalblue; font-weight: bold;">PredRel&lt;/span>;&lt;br /> defm Or : ALU32_base&amp;lt;"or", "OR", or&amp;gt;, &lt;span style="color: royalblue; font-weight: bold;">PredRel&lt;/span>;&lt;br />}&lt;br />defm Sub : ALU32_base&amp;lt;"sub", "SUB", sub&amp;gt;, &lt;span style="color: royalblue; font-weight: bold;">PredRel&lt;/span>;&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/mnemonic>&lt;/mnemonic>&lt;/string>&lt;/string>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>Fields highlighted in blue are solely for the purpose of Relationship framework. Here, &lt;tt>PredRel&lt;/tt> is a filter class used to extract instructions that may be related using &lt;tt>getPredicated&lt;/tt> relationship model. All the instructions using this model are expected to derive from &lt;tt>PreRel&lt;/tt> class. &lt;tt>BaseOpcode&lt;/tt> is used to group related instructions together. In the above example, all the variants of &lt;tt>Add&lt;/tt> instruction, &lt;tt>Add, Add_pt, Add_pf&lt;/tt> will have their BaseOpcode set to &lt;tt>ADD&lt;/tt>. Similarly, &lt;tt>BaseOpcode&lt;/tt> for all the variants for &lt;tt>Sub&lt;/tt> is set to &lt;tt>SUB&lt;/tt>. It can be any string unique across all groups. &lt;tt>PredSense&lt;/tt> is used to identify instructions within each group.&lt;br />&lt;br />With the help of this extra information, TableGen is able to construct the following API. It offers the same functionality as switch-case based approach and significantly reduces the maintenance overhead: &lt;br \>&lt;div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff;">&lt;pre style="line-height: 150%;">&lt;br />&lt;br />int getPredicated(uint16_t Opcode, enum PredSense inPredSense) {&lt;br />static const uint16_t getPredicatedTable[][3] = {&lt;br /> { Hexagon::Add, Hexagon::Add_pt, Hexagon::Add_pf },&lt;br /> { Hexagon::And, Hexagon::And_pt, Hexagon::And_pf },&lt;br /> { Hexagon::Or, Hexagon::Or_pt, Hexagon::Or_pf },&lt;br /> { Hexagon::Sub, Hexagon::Sub_pt, Hexagon::Sub_pf },&lt;br /> { Hexagon::Xor, Hexagon::Xor_pt, Hexagon::Xor_pf },&lt;br />}; // End of getPredicatedTable&lt;br />&lt;br /> unsigned mid;&lt;br /> unsigned start = 0;&lt;br /> unsigned end = 5;&lt;br /> while (start &amp;lt; end) {&lt;br /> mid = start + (end - start)/2;&lt;br /> if (Opcode == getPredicatedTable[mid][0]) {&lt;br /> break;&lt;br /> }&lt;br /> if (Opcode &amp;lt; getPredicatedTable[mid][0])&lt;br /> end = mid;&lt;br /> else&lt;br /> start = mid + 1;&lt;br /> }&lt;br /> if (start == end)&lt;br /> return -1; // Instruction doesn't exist in this table.&lt;br />&lt;br /> if (inPredSense == PredSense_true)&lt;br /> return getPredOpcodeTable[mid][1];&lt;br /> if (inPredSense == PredSense_false)&lt;br /> return getPredicatedTable[mid][2];&lt;br /> return -1;&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>Once instructions have been defined to appropriately model their properties, defining new instruction mappings become extremely easy. Now, say we want to have an API that allows us to transform a &lt;tt>predicate-true&lt;/tt> instruction into its &lt;tt>predicate-false&lt;/tt> form. This can be done by defining a new relationship model. For this model, we don't have to modify any of the instruction definitions as they already have all the necessary information present. &lt;br \>&lt;div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff;">&lt;pre style="line-height: 150%;">&lt;br />&lt;br />//===------------------------------------------------------------------===//&lt;br />// Generate mapping table to relate predicate-true instructions with their&lt;br />// predicate-false forms&lt;br />//&lt;br />def getFalsePredOpcode : InstrMapping {&lt;br /> let FilterClass = "PredRel";&lt;br /> let RowFields = ["BaseOpcode"];&lt;br /> let ColFields = ["PredSense"];&lt;br /> let KeyCol = ["true"];&lt;br /> let ValueCols = [["false"]];&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;/div> &lt;!-- ======================================================================= -->&lt;h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion:&lt;/h3>&lt;!-- ======================================================================= --> I hope this article succeeds in providing some useful information about the framework. The Hexagon backend makes extensive use of this feature and can be used as a reference for getting started on relationship framework.</description></item><item><title>New Loop Vectorizer</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2012/12/new-loop-vectorizer.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2012 10:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2012/12/new-loop-vectorizer.html</guid><description>
I would like to give a brief update regarding the development of the Loop Vectorizer. LLVM now has two vectorizers: The Loop Vectorizer, which operates on Loops, and the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2012-04-12/Slides/Hal_Finkel.pdf">Basic Block Vectorizer&lt;/a>, which optimizes straight-line code. These vectorizers focus on different optimization opportunities and use different techniques. The BB vectorizer merges multiple scalars that are found in the code into vectors while the Loop Vectorizer widens instructions in the original loop to operate on multiple consecutive loop iterations. &lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />LLVM’s Loop Vectorizer is now available and will be useful for many people. It is not enabled by default, but can be enabled through clang using the command line flag &lt;b>"-mllvm -vectorize-loops"&lt;/b>. We plan to enable the Loop Vectorizer by default as part of the LLVM 3.3 release. &lt;br />&lt;br />The Loop Vectorizer can boost the performance of many loops, including some loops that are not vectorizable by GCC. In one benchmark, Linpack-pc, the Loop Vectorizer boosts the performance of gaussian elimination of single precision matrices from 984 MFlops to 2539 MFlops - a 2.6X boost in performance. The vectorizer also boosts the “GCC vectorization examples” &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project/test-suite/trunk/SingleSource/UnitTests/Vectorizer/">benchmark&lt;/a> by a geomean of 2.15X.&lt;br />&lt;br />The LLVM Loop Vectorizer has a number of features that allow it to vectorize complex loops. Most of the features described in this post are available as part of the LLVM 3.2 release, but some features were added after the cutoff date. Here is one small example of a loop that the LLVM Loop Vectorizer can vectorize. &lt;br />&lt;pre style="background: #ffffff; color: black;">&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> foo&lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">*&lt;/span>A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">*&lt;/span>B&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> n&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: purple;">{&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">unsigned&lt;/span> sum &lt;span style="color: #808030;">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #008c00;">0&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">for&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> i &lt;span style="color: #808030;">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #008c00;">0&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span> i &lt;span style="color: #808030;">&amp;lt;&lt;/span> n&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span>i&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">if&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>i&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">&amp;gt;&lt;/span> B&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>i&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span>&lt;br /> sum &lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">=&lt;/span> A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>i&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #008c00;">5&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">return&lt;/span> sum&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: purple;">}&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />In this example, the Loop Vectorizer uses a number of non-trivial features to vectorize the loop. The ‘sum’ variable is used by consecutive iterations of the loop. Normally, this would prevent vectorization, but the vectorizer can detect that ‘sum’ is a reduction variable. The variable ‘sum’ becomes a vector of integers, and at the end of the loop the elements of the array are added together to create the correct result. We support a number of different reduction operations, such as multiplication.&lt;br/>&lt;br/> Another challenge that the Loop Vectorizer needs to overcome is the presence of control flow in the loop. The Loop Vectorizer is able to "flatten" the IF statement in the code and generate a single stream of instructions. Another important feature is the vectorization of loops with an unknown trip count. In this example, ‘n’ may not be a multiple of the vector width, and the vectorizer has to execute the last few iterations as scalar code. Keeping a scalar copy of the loop increases the code size. &lt;br/>The loop above is compiled into the ARMv7s assembly sequence below. Notice that the IF structure is replaced by the "vcgt" and "vbsl" instructions.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre style='color:#000000;background:#ffffff;'>&lt;span style='color:#e34adc; '>LBB0_3:&lt;/span>&lt;br /> vld1.32 &lt;span style='color:#808030; '>{&lt;/span>d26&lt;span style='color:#808030; '>,&lt;/span> d27&lt;span style='color:#808030; '>}&lt;/span>&lt;span style='color:#808030; '>,&lt;/span> &lt;span style='color:#808030; '>[&lt;/span>r3&lt;span style='color:#808030; '>]&lt;/span>&lt;br /> vadd.i32 q12&lt;span style='color:#808030; '>,&lt;/span> q8&lt;span style='color:#808030; '>,&lt;/span> q9&lt;br /> subs r2&lt;span style='color:#808030; '>,&lt;/span> #&lt;span style='color:#008c00; '>4&lt;/span>&lt;br /> add.w r3&lt;span style='color:#808030; '>,&lt;/span> r3&lt;span style='color:#808030; '>,&lt;/span> #&lt;span style='color:#008c00; '>16&lt;/span>&lt;br /> vcgt.s32 q0&lt;span style='color:#808030; '>,&lt;/span> q13 &lt;span style='color:#808030; '>,&lt;/span> q10&lt;br /> vmla.i32 q12&lt;span style='color:#808030; '>,&lt;/span> q13&lt;span style='color:#808030; '>,&lt;/span> q11&lt;br /> vbsl q0&lt;span style='color:#808030; '>,&lt;/span> q12&lt;span style='color:#808030; '>,&lt;/span> q8&lt;br /> vorr q8&lt;span style='color:#808030; '>,&lt;/span> q0&lt;span style='color:#808030; '>,&lt;/span> q0&lt;br /> bne &lt;span style='color:#e34adc; '>LBB0_3&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre> &lt;br />In the second example below, the Loop Vectorizer must use two more features in order to vectorize the loop. In the loop below, the iteration start and finish points are unknown, and the Loop Vectorizer has a mechanism to vectorize loops that do not start at zero. This feature is important for loops that are converted from Fortran, because Fortran loops start at 1. &lt;br />Another major challenge in this loop is memory safety. In our example, if the pointers A and B point to consecutive addresses, then it is illegal to vectorize the code because some elements of A will be written before they are read from array B.&lt;br />&lt;br />Some programmers use the 'restrict' keyword to notify the compiler that the pointers are disjointed, but in our example, the Loop Vectorizer has no way of knowing that the pointers A and B are unique. The Loop Vectorizer handles this loop by placing code that checks, at runtime, if the arrays A and B point to disjointed memory locations. If arrays A and B overlap, then the scalar version of the loop is executed. &lt;br />&lt;pre style="background: #ffffff; color: black;">&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">void&lt;/span> bar&lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">float&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">*&lt;/span>A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">float&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">*&lt;/span>B&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">float&lt;/span> K&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> start&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> end&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: purple;">{&lt;/span>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">for&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> i &lt;span style="color: #808030;">=&lt;/span> start&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span> i &lt;span style="color: #808030;">&amp;lt;&lt;/span> end&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span>i&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>i&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">*&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">=&lt;/span> B&lt;span style="color: #808030;">[&lt;/span>i&lt;span style="color: #808030;">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span> K&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: purple;">}&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />The loop above is compiled into this X86 assembly sequence.

This loop uses c++ iterators, which are pointers, and not integer indices, like we saw in the previous examples. The Loop Vectorizer detects pointer induction variables and can vectorize this loop. This feature is important because many C++ programs use iterators.&lt;br />&lt;pre style="background: #ffffff; color: black;">&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> baz&lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">*&lt;/span>A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> n&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: purple;">{&lt;/span>&lt;br /> &lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;">return&lt;/span> std&lt;span style="color: purple;">::&lt;/span>accumulate&lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>A&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> A &lt;span style="color: #808030;">+&lt;/span> n&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #008c00;">0&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: purple;">;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: purple;">}&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>The loop above is compiled into this x86 assembly sequence. &lt;br />&lt;pre style="background: #ffffff; color: black;">&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: #e34adc;">LBB2_8:&lt;/span>&lt;br /> vmovdqu &lt;span style="color: #808030;">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>rcx&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>rdx&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #008c00;">4&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">)&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: navy;">xmm1&lt;/span>&lt;br /> vpaddd &lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: navy;">xmm0&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: navy;">xmm1&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: navy;">xmm0&lt;/span>&lt;br /> addq &lt;span style="color: green;">$4&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>rdx&lt;br /> cmpq &lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>rdx&lt;span style="color: #808030;">,&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #808030;">%&lt;/span>rsi&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bold;"> jne&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #e34adc;">LBB2_8&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br/> The Loop Vectorizer is a target independent IR-level optimization that depends on target-specific information from the different backends. It needs to select the optimal vector width and to decide if vectorization is worthwhile. Users can force a certain vector width using the command line flag &lt;b>"-mllvm -force-vector-width=X"&lt;/b>, where X is the number of vector elements. At the moment, only the X86 backend provides detailed cost information, while other targets use a less accurate method. &lt;br/>The work on the Loop Vectorizer is not complete and the vectorizer has a long way to go. We plan to add additional vectorization features such as automatic alignment of buffers, vectorization of function calls and support for user pragmas. We also plan to improve the quality of the generated code. &lt;br/> &lt;br/></description></item><item><title>LLVM Developer Meeting 2012</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2012/12/llvm-developer-meeting-2012.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2012 19:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2012/12/llvm-developer-meeting-2012.html</guid><description>

&lt;br />LLVM is a complex piece of software. There are several paths one may take on the quest of understanding how it works, none of which is simple. I recently had to dig in some areas of LLVM I was not previously familiar with, and this article is one of the outcomes of this quest.&lt;br />&lt;br />What I aim to do here is follow the various incarnations an "instruction" takes when it goes through LLVM’s multiple compilation stages, starting from a syntactic construct in the source language and until being encoded as binary machine code in an output object file.&lt;br />&lt;br />This article in itself will not teach one how LLVM works. It assumes some existing familiarity with LLVM’s design and code base, and leaves a lot of "obvious" details out. Note that unless otherwise stated, the information here is relevant to LLVM 3.2. LLVM and Clang are fast-moving projects, and future changes may render parts of this article incorrect. If you notice any discrepancies, please let me know and I’ll do my best to fix them.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;div class="section" id="input-code">&lt;h3>Input code&lt;/h3>I want to start this exploration process at the beginning – C source. Here’s the simple function we’re going to work with:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff;">&lt;pre style="line-height: 125%;">&lt;span style="font-size: small;">&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color: #00007f;">foo&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> aa, &lt;span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> bb, &lt;span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> cc) {&lt;br /> &lt;span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold;">int&lt;/span> sum = aa + bb;&lt;br /> &lt;span style="color: #00007f; font-weight: bold;">return&lt;/span> sum / cc;&lt;br />}&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;br />The focus of this article is going to be on the division operation.&lt;/div>&lt;div class="section" id="clang">&lt;h3>Clang&lt;/h3>Clang serves as the front-end for LLVM, responsible for converting C, C++ and ObjC source into LLVM IR. Clang’s main complexity comes from the ability to correctly parse and semantically analyze C++; the flow for a simple C-level operation is actually quite straightforward.&lt;br />&lt;br />Clang’s parser builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) out of the input. The AST is the main "currency" in which various parts of Clang deal. For our division operation, a &lt;tt class="docutils literal">BinaryOperator&lt;/tt> node is created in the AST, carrying the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">BO_div&lt;/tt> "operator kind". Clang’s code generator then goes on to emit a &lt;tt class="docutils literal">sdiv&lt;/tt> LLVM IR instruction from the node, since this is a division of signed integral types.&lt;br />&lt;div class="section" id="llvm-ir">&lt;h3>LLVM IR&lt;/h3>Here is the LLVM IR created for the function:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff;">&lt;pre style="line-height: 125%;">define i32 @foo(i32 %aa, i32 %bb, i32 %cc) nounwind {&lt;br />entry:&lt;br /> %add = add nsw i32 %aa, %bb&lt;br /> %div = sdiv i32 %add, %cc&lt;br /> ret i32 %div&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;br />In LLVM IR, &lt;tt class="docutils literal">sdiv&lt;/tt> is a &lt;tt class="docutils literal">BinaryOperator&lt;/tt>, which is a subclass of &lt;tt class="docutils literal">Instruction&lt;/tt> with the opcode &lt;tt class="docutils literal">SDiv&lt;/tt>. Like any other instruction, it can be processed by the LLVM analysis and transformation passes. For a specific example targeted at &lt;tt class="docutils literal">SDiv&lt;/tt>, take a look at &lt;tt class="docutils literal">SimplifySDivInst&lt;/tt>. Since all through the LLVM "middle-end" layer the instruction remains in its IR form, I won’t spend much time talking about it. To witness its next incarnation, we’ll have to look at the LLVM code generator.&lt;br />&lt;br />The code generator is one of the most complex parts of LLVM. Its task is to "lower" the relatively high-level, target-independent LLVM IR into low-level, target-dependent "machine instructions" (&lt;tt class="docutils literal">MachineInstr&lt;/tt>). On its way to a &lt;tt class="docutils literal">MachineInstr&lt;/tt>, an LLVM IR instruction passes through a "selection DAG node" incarnation, which is what I’m going to discuss next.&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;h3>SelectionDAG node&lt;/h3>Selection DAG nodes are created by the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">SelectionDAGBuilder&lt;/tt> class acting "in the service of" &lt;tt class="docutils literal">SelectionDAGISel&lt;/tt>, which is the main base class for instruction selection. &lt;tt class="docutils literal">SelectionDAGISel&lt;/tt> goes over all the IR instructions and calls the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">SelectionDAGBuilder::visit&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> dispatcher on them. The method handling a &lt;tt class="docutils literal">SDiv&lt;/tt> instruction is &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">SelectionDAGBuilder::visitSDiv&lt;/span>&lt;/tt>. It requests a new &lt;tt class="docutils literal">SDNode&lt;/tt> from the DAG with the opcode &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">ISD::SDIV&lt;/span>&lt;/tt>, which becomes a node in the DAG.&lt;br />&lt;br />The initial DAG constructed this way is still only partially target dependent. In LLVM nomenclature it’s called "illegal" – the types it contains may not be directly supported by the target; the same is true for the operations it contains.&lt;br />&lt;br />There are a couple of ways to visualize the DAG. One is to pass the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">-debug&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> flag to &lt;tt class="docutils literal">llc&lt;/tt>, which will cause it to create a textual dump of the DAG during all the selection phases. Another is to pass one of the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">-view&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> options which causes it to dump and display an actual image of the graph (more details in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://llvm.org/docs/CodeGenerator.html">code generator docs&lt;/a>). Here’s the relevant portion of the DAG showing our &lt;tt class="docutils literal">SDiv&lt;/tt> node, right after DAG creation (the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">sdiv&lt;/tt> node is in the bottom):&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SjbbSsuPKbo/ULTDEf2o5hI/AAAAAAAAAgM/CmQd_eeGowY/s1600/sdiv_initial_dag.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SjbbSsuPKbo/ULTDEf2o5hI/AAAAAAAAAgM/CmQd_eeGowY/s1600/sdiv_initial_dag.png" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;br />Before the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">SelectionDAG&lt;/tt> machinery actually emits machine instructions from DAG nodes, these undergo a few other transformations. The most important are the type and operation legalization steps, which use target-specific hooks to convert all operations and types into ones that the target actually supports.&lt;br />&lt;h3>"Legalizing" sdiv into sdivrem on x86&lt;/h3>The division instruction (&lt;tt class="docutils literal">idiv&lt;/tt> for signed operands) of x86 computes both the quotient and the remainder of the operation, and stores them in two separate registers. Since LLVM’s instruction selection distinguishes between such operations (called &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">ISD::SDIVREM&lt;/span>&lt;/tt>) and division that only computes the quotient (&lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">ISD::SDIV&lt;/span>&lt;/tt>), our DAG node will be "legalized" during the DAG legalization phase when the target is x86. Here’s how it happens.&lt;br />&lt;br />An important interface used by the code generator to convey target-specific information to the generally target-independent algorithms is &lt;tt class="docutils literal">TargetLowering&lt;/tt>. Targets implement this interface to describe how LLVM IR instructions should be lowered to legal &lt;tt class="docutils literal">SelectionDAG&lt;/tt> operations. The x86 implementation of this interface is &lt;tt class="docutils literal">X86TargetLowering&lt;/tt>. In its constructor it marks which operations need to be "expanded" by operation legalization, and &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">ISD::SDIV&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> is one of them. Here’s an interesting comment from the code:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff;">&lt;pre style="line-height: 125%;">&lt;span style="color: #007f00;">&lt;br />// Scalar integer divide and remainder are lowered to use operations that&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: #007f00;">// produce two results, to match the available instructions. This exposes&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: #007f00;">// the two-result form to trivial CSE, which is able to combine x/y and x%y&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="color: #007f00;">// into a single instruction.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&amp;nbsp; &lt;br />When &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">SelectionDAGLegalize::LegalizeOp&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> sees the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">Expand&lt;/tt> flag on a SDIV node it replaces it by &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">ISD::SDIVREM&lt;/span>&lt;/tt>. This is an interesting example to demonstrate the transformation an operation can undergo while in the selection DAG form.&lt;br />&lt;br />Here is the relevant portion of the DAG after legalization:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4Hr-DU4FbR0/ULTCadxhrgI/AAAAAAAAAgE/hzLJ9YqVdT4/s1600/sdivrem_legal_dag.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4Hr-DU4FbR0/ULTCadxhrgI/AAAAAAAAAgE/hzLJ9YqVdT4/s1600/sdivrem_legal_dag.png" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;br />&lt;div class="section" id="instruction-selection-from-sdnode-to-machinesdnode">&lt;h3>Instruction selection – from SDNode to MachineSDNode&lt;/h3>The next step in the code generation process is &lt;i>instruction selection&lt;/i>. LLVM provides a generic table-based instruction selection mechanism that is auto-generated with the help of TableGen. Many target backends, however, choose to write custom code in their &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">SelectionDAGISel::Select&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> implementations to handle some instructions manually. Other instructions are then sent to the auto-generated selector by calling &lt;tt class="docutils literal">SelectCode&lt;/tt>.&lt;br />&lt;br />The X86 backend handles &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">ISD::SDIVREM&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> manually in order to take care of some special cases and optimizations. The DAG node created at this step is a &lt;tt class="docutils literal">MachineSDNode&lt;/tt>, a subclass of &lt;tt class="docutils literal">SDNode&lt;/tt> which holds the information required to construct an actual machine instruction, but still in DAG node form. At this point the actual X86 instruction opcode is selected – &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">X86::IDIV32r&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> in our case.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-odnuGpLx3EA/ULTEEYSivqI/AAAAAAAAAgU/bcQZtTPOw2c/s1600/idiv_after_isel.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-odnuGpLx3EA/ULTEEYSivqI/AAAAAAAAAgU/bcQZtTPOw2c/s1600/idiv_after_isel.png" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;h3>Scheduling and emitting a MachineInstr&lt;/h3>The code we have at this point is still represented as a DAG. But CPUs don’t execute DAGs, they execute a linear sequence of instructions. The goal of the scheduling step is to linearize the DAG by assigning an order to its operations (nodes). The simplest approach would be to just sort the DAG topologically, but LLVM’s code generator employs clever heuristics (such as register pressure reduction) to try and produce a schedule that would result in faster code.&lt;br />Each target has some hooks it can implement to affect the way scheduling is done. I won't dwell on this topic here, however.&lt;br />&lt;br />Finally, the scheduler emits a list of instructions into a &lt;tt class="docutils literal">MachineBasicBlock&lt;/tt>, using &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">InstrEmitter::EmitMachineNode&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> to translate from &lt;tt class="docutils literal">SDNode&lt;/tt>. The instructions here take the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">MachineInstr&lt;/tt> form ("MI form" from now on), and the DAG can be destroyed.&lt;br />We can examine the machine instructions emitted in this step by calling &lt;tt class="docutils literal">llc&lt;/tt> with the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">-print-machineinstrs&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> flag and looking at the first output that says "After instruction selection":&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre style="line-height: 125%;">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;,Courier,monospace;">&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;">&lt;br /># After Instruction Selection:&lt;br /># Machine code for function foo: SSA&lt;br />Function Live Ins: %EDI in %vreg0, %ESI in %vreg1, %EDX in %vreg2&lt;br />Function Live Outs: %EAX&lt;br />&lt;br />BB#0: derived from LLVM BB %entry&lt;br /> Live Ins: %EDI %ESI %EDX&lt;br /> %vreg2&amp;lt;def&amp;gt; = COPY %EDX; GR32:%vreg2&lt;br /> %vreg1&amp;lt;def&amp;gt; = COPY %ESI; GR32:%vreg1&lt;br /> %vreg0&amp;lt;def&amp;gt; = COPY %EDI; GR32:%vreg0&lt;br /> %vreg3&amp;lt;def,tied1&amp;gt; = ADD32rr %vreg0&amp;lt;tied0&amp;gt;, %vreg1, %EFLAGS&amp;lt;imp-def,dead&amp;gt;; GR32:%vreg3,%vreg0,%vreg1&lt;br /> %EAX&amp;lt;def&amp;gt; = COPY %vreg3; GR32:%vreg3&lt;br /> CDQ %EAX&amp;lt;imp-def&amp;gt;, %EDX&amp;lt;imp-def&amp;gt;, %EAX&amp;lt;imp-use&amp;gt;&lt;br /> IDIV32r %vreg2, %EAX&amp;lt;imp-def&amp;gt;, %EDX&amp;lt;imp-def,dead&amp;gt;, %EFLAGS&amp;lt;imp-def,dead&amp;gt;, %EAX&amp;lt;imp-use&amp;gt;, %EDX&amp;lt;imp-use&amp;gt;; GR32:%vreg2&lt;br /> %vreg4&amp;lt;def&amp;gt; = COPY %EAX; GR32:%vreg4&lt;br /> %EAX&amp;lt;def&amp;gt; = COPY %vreg4; GR32:%vreg4&lt;br /> RET&lt;br />&lt;br /># End machine code for function foo.&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/pre>&lt;pre style="line-height: 125%;">&amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre>Note that the output mentions that the code is in SSA form, and we can see that some registers being used are "virtual" registers (e.g. &lt;tt class="docutils literal">%vreg1&lt;/tt>).&lt;br />&lt;div class="section" id="register-allocation-from-ssa-to-non-ssa-machine-instructions">&lt;h3>Register allocation – from SSA to non-SSA machine instructions&lt;/h3>Apart from some well-defined exceptions, the code generated from the instruction selector is in SSA form. In particular, it assumes it has an infinite set of "virtual" registers to act on. This, of course, isn’t true. Therefore, the next step of the code generator is to invoke a "register allocator", whose task is to replace virtual by physical registers, from the target’s register bank.&lt;br />&lt;br />The exceptions mentioned above are also important and interesting, so let’s talk about them a bit more.&lt;br />&lt;br />Some instructions in some architectures require fixed registers. A good example is our division instruction in x86, which requires its inputs to be in the EDX and EAX registers. The instruction selector knows about these restrictions, so as we can see in the code above, the inputs to &lt;tt class="docutils literal">IDIV32r&lt;/tt> are physical, not virtual registers. This assignment is done by &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">X86DAGToDAGISel::Select&lt;/span>&lt;/tt>.&lt;br />&lt;br />The register allocator takes care of all the non-fixed registers. There are a few more optimization (and pseudo-instruction expansion) steps that happen on machine instructions in SSA form, but I’m going to skip these. Similarly, I’m not going to discuss the steps performed after register allocation, since these don’t change the basic form operations appear in (&lt;tt class="docutils literal">MachineInstr&lt;/tt>, at this point). If you’re interested, take a look at &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">TargetPassConfig::addMachinePasses&lt;/span>&lt;/tt>.&lt;br />&lt;br />Here's the MIs dumped after register allocation:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre style="line-height: 125%;">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;,Courier,monospace;">&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;">&lt;br /># After Virtual Register Rewriter:&lt;br /># Machine code for function foo: Post SSA&lt;br />Function Live Ins: %EDI in %vreg0, %ESI in %vreg1, %EDX in %vreg2&lt;br />Function Live Outs: %EAX&lt;br />&lt;br />0B BB#0: derived from LLVM BB %entry&lt;br /> Live Ins: %EDI %ESI %EDX&lt;br />16B %ECX&lt;def> = COPY %EDX&lt;br />64B %EAX&lt;def> = LEA64_32r %EDI&lt;kill>, 1, %ESI&lt;kill>, 0, %noreg&lt;br />96B CDQ %EAX&lt;imp-def>, %EDX&lt;imp-def>, %EAX&lt;imp-use>&lt;br />112B IDIV32r %ECX&lt;kill>, %EAX&lt;imp-def>, %EDX&lt;imp-def dead="dead">, %EFLAGS&lt;imp-def dead="dead">, %EAX&lt;imp-use>, %EDX&lt;imp-use>&lt;br />160B RET %EAX&lt;imp-use>&lt;br />&lt;br /># End machine code for function foo.&lt;br />&lt;/imp-use>&lt;/imp-use>&lt;/imp-use>&lt;/imp-def>&lt;/imp-def>&lt;/imp-def>&lt;/kill>&lt;/imp-use>&lt;/imp-def>&lt;/imp-def>&lt;/kill>&lt;/kill>&lt;/def>&lt;/def>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/pre>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div class="section" id="emitting-code">&lt;h3>Emitting code&lt;/h3>So we now have our original C function translated to MI form – a &lt;tt class="docutils literal">MachineFunction&lt;/tt> filled with instruction objects (&lt;tt class="docutils literal">MachineInstr&lt;/tt>). This is the point at which the code generator has finished its job and we can emit the code. In current LLVM, there are two ways to do that. One is the (legacy) JIT which emits executable, ready-to-run code directly into memory. The other is MC, which is an ambitious object-file-and-assembly framework that’s been part of LLVM for a couple of years, replacing the previous assembly generator. MC is currently being used for assembly and object file emission for all (or at least the important) LLVM targets. MC also enables "MCJIT", which is a JIT-ting framework based on the MC layer. This is why I’m referring to LLVM’s JIT module as legacy.&lt;br />&lt;br />I will first say a few words about the legacy JIT and then turn to MC, which is more universally interesting.&lt;br />&lt;br />The sequence of passes to JIT-emit code is defined by &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">LLVMTargetMachine::addPassesToEmitMachineCode&lt;/span>&lt;/tt>. It calls &lt;tt class="docutils literal">addPassesToGenerateCode&lt;/tt>, which defines all the passes required to do what most of this article has been talking about until now – turning IR into MI form. Next, it calls &lt;tt class="docutils literal">addCodeEmitter&lt;/tt>, which is a target-specific pass for converting MIs into actual machine code. Since MIs are already very low-level, it’s fairly straightforward to translate them to runnable machine code. The x86 code for that lives in &lt;tt class="docutils literal">lib/Target/X86/X86CodeEmitter.cpp&lt;/tt>. For our division instruction there’s no special handling here, because the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">MachineInstr&lt;/tt> it’s packaged in already contains its opcode and operands. It is handled generically with other instructions in &lt;tt class="docutils literal">emitInstruction&lt;/tt>.&lt;/div>&lt;h3>MCInst&lt;/h3>When LLVM is used as a static compiler (as part of &lt;tt class="docutils literal">clang&lt;/tt>, for instance), MIs are passed down to the MC layer which handles the object-file emission (it can also emit textual assembly files). Much can be said about MC, but that would require an article of its own. A good reference is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/intro-to-llvm-mc-project.html">this post from the LLVM blog&lt;/a>. I will keep focusing on the path a single instruction takes.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">LLVMTargetMachine::addPassesToEmitFile&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> is responsible for defining the sequence of actions required to emit an object file. The actual MI-to-&lt;tt class="docutils literal">MCInst&lt;/tt> translation is done in the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">EmitInstruction&lt;/tt> of the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">AsmPrinter&lt;/tt> interface. For x86, this method is implemented by &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">X86AsmPrinter::EmitInstruction&lt;/span>&lt;/tt>, which delegates the work to the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">X86MCInstLower&lt;/tt> class. Similarly to the JIT path, there is no special handling for our division instruction at this point, and it’s treated generically with other instructions.&lt;br />&lt;br />By passing &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">-show-mc-inst&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> and &lt;tt>-show-mc-encoding&lt;/tt> to &lt;tt class="docutils literal">llc&lt;/tt>, we can see the MC-level instructions it creates with their encoding, alongside the actual assembly code:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre style="line-height: 125%;">&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;Courier New&amp;quot;,Courier,monospace;">&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;">&lt;br />foo: # @foo&lt;br /># BB#0: # %entry&lt;br /> movl %edx, %ecx # encoding: [0x89,0xd1]&lt;br /> # &amp;lt;MCInst #1483 MOV32rr&lt;br /> # &amp;lt;MCOperand Reg:46&amp;gt;&lt;br /> # &amp;lt;MCOperand Reg:48&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br /> leal (%rdi,%rsi), %eax # encoding: [0x8d,0x04,0x37]&lt;br /> # &amp;lt;MCInst #1096 LEA64_32r&lt;br /> # &amp;lt;MCOperand Reg:43&amp;gt;&lt;br /> # &amp;lt;MCOperand Reg:110&amp;gt;&lt;br /> # &amp;lt;MCOperand Imm:1&amp;gt;&lt;br /> # &amp;lt;MCOperand Reg:114&amp;gt;&lt;br /> # &amp;lt;MCOperand Imm:0&amp;gt;&lt;br /> # &amp;lt;MCOperand Reg:0&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br /> cltd # encoding: [0x99]&lt;br /> # &amp;lt;MCInst #352 CDQ&amp;gt;&lt;br /> idivl %ecx # encoding: [0xf7,0xf9]&lt;br /> # &amp;lt;MCInst #841 IDIV32r&lt;br /> # &amp;lt;MCOperand Reg:46&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br /> ret # encoding: [0xc3]&lt;br /> # &amp;lt;MCInst #2227 RET&amp;gt;&lt;br />.Ltmp0:&lt;br /> .size foo, .Ltmp0-foo&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/pre>&lt;br />&lt;br />The object file (or assembly code) emission is done by implementing the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">MCStreamer&lt;/tt> interface. Object files are emitted by &lt;tt class="docutils literal">MCObjectStreamer&lt;/tt>, which is further subclassed according to the actual object file format. For example, ELF emission is implemented in &lt;tt class="docutils literal">MCELFStreamer&lt;/tt>. The rough path a &lt;tt class="docutils literal">MCInst&lt;/tt> travels through the streamers is &lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">MCObjectStreamer::EmitInstruction&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> followed by a format-specific &lt;tt class="docutils literal">EmitInstToData&lt;/tt>. The final emission of the instruction in binary form is, of course, target-specific. It’s handled by the &lt;tt class="docutils literal">MCCodeEmitter&lt;/tt> interface (for example &lt;tt class="docutils literal">X86MCCodeEmitter&lt;/tt>). While in the rest of LLVM code is often tricky because it has to make a separation between target-independent and target-specific capabilities, MC is even more challenging because it adds another dimension – different object file formats. So some code is completely generic, some code is format-dependent, and some code is target-dependent.&lt;br />&lt;h3>Assemblers and disassemblers&lt;/h3>A &lt;tt class="docutils literal">MCInst&lt;/tt> is deliberately a very simple representation. It tries to shed as much semantic information as possible, keeping only the instruction opcode and list of operands (and a source location for assembler diagnostics). Like LLVM IR, it’s an internal representation will multiple possible encodings. The two most obvious are assembly (as shown above) and binary object files.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;tt class="docutils literal">&lt;span class="pre">llvm-mc&lt;/span>&lt;/tt> is a tool that uses the MC framework to implement assemblers and disassemblers. Internally, &lt;tt class="docutils literal">MCInst&lt;/tt> is the representation used to translate between the binary and textual forms. At this point the tool doesn’t care which compiler produced the assembly / object file.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h3>Conclusion&lt;/h3>&lt;br />Presenting a "big picture" view of a complex system as LLVM isn't easy. I hope that this article succeeds in giving some clues about the internal workings of LLVM in a way that is useful for further exploration. &lt;br />&lt;pre style="line-height: 125%;">&amp;nbsp;&lt;/pre>&lt;i>[This article is re-posted in a slightly expanded form &lt;a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/11/24/life-of-an-instruction-in-llvm/">from here&lt;/a>]&lt;/i>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br /></description></item><item><title>LLVM Developer Meeting 2011</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2012/01/llvm-developer-meeting-2011.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2012 12:44:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2012/01/llvm-developer-meeting-2011.html</guid><description>

From the NVIDIA CUDA compiler team:&lt;p> &lt;blockquote>CUDA is a parallel programming model and platform created by NVIDIA for harnessing the power of hundreds of cores in modern graphics processing units (GPUs). NVIDIA provides free support for CUDA C and C++ in the CUDA toolkit. The CUDA programming environment consists of a compiler targeting NVIDIA GPUs and has been adopted by thousands of developers.&lt;p> At NVIDIA we have switched over to using LLVM inside the CUDA C/C++ compiler for Fermi and future architectures. We use LLVM for optimizations and PTX code generation and for generating debug information for CUDA debugging. From a developer's perspective the new compiler is functionally on par with the previous compilers and produces better code with better compile times. We have extended the LLVM core compiler to understand data parallel programming model. It is now available, as part of CUDA 4.1 and you can &lt;a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/content/new-cuda-now-available">learn more here&lt;/a>.&lt;p> Our experience with the use of LLVM has been very positive, starting with a modern compiler infrastructure and with high quality optimizations contributed by a large community of developers. The effort required to learn LLVM infrastructure is quite small and reasonable. &lt;/blockquote></description></item><item><title>LLVM 3.1 vector changes</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2011/12/llvm-31-vector-changes.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2011 04:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2011/12/llvm-31-vector-changes.html</guid><description>
Intel uses the Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) in a number of products, including the &lt;a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/vcsource-tools-opencl-sdk/">Intel® OpenCL SDK&lt;/a>. The SDK's implicit vectorization module generates LLVM-IR (intermediate representation) which uses vector types.&lt;p>LLVM-IR supports operations that use vector data types, and the LLVM code generator needs to do non-trivial work in order to efficiently compile vector operations into SIMD instructions. Recently, there were changes to the LLVM code generation that enabled better code generation for vector operations. In addition to many low level optimizations, this post talks about two major changes: the implementation of vector-select, and the support for vectors-of-pointers.&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;h2>The LLVM-IR select instruction&lt;/h2>The LLVM IR 'select' instruction is used to choose one value based on a condition. If the condition evaluates to 'True', the instruction returns the first value argument; otherwise, it returns the second value argument. For example:&lt;pre> %X = select i1 true, i8 17, i8 42 ; yields i8:17&lt;/pre>The 'select' instruction also supports vector data types, where the condition is a vector of boolean data type. If the condition is a vector of booleans (see above), then the selection is done per element.&lt;p>Vector-select instructions are very useful for vectorizing compilers, which use them to 'mask-out' inactive SIMD lanes. Until recently, the LLVM code generator did not support conditions with vector data types. Enabling them required enhancing several other areas of the code generator.&lt;h2>SSE blends&lt;/h2>Intel's SSE4.1 instruction set features the PBLENDVB instruction. This instruction selects byte values from registers XMM1 and XMM2, using a mask specified in the high bit of each byte in XMM0, and stores the values into XMM1. There are also other instructions for handling larger data types, such as 32-bit integers, etc. It may seem odd for the selector bits to be the high bit, but the vector-compare machine instructions also set the high bits, so that the compare and blend instructions can work together efficiently.&lt;p>As mentioned earlier, the LLVM-IR 'select' instruction represents the mask as a vector of booleans, which need to be translated into the high-bit of each SIMD vector element. This translation is done by the Type-Legalizer phase in the LLVM code generator.&lt;h2>Type Legalization&lt;/h2>The Type Legalizer is a code generation phase that converts operations of any arbitrary data type which is represented by the LLVM-IR, into operations that use types which are supported by the target machine. For example, on x86 architecture, general purpose registers support the types i8, i16, i32 and i64. These types are 'Legal' because they fit into a machine register. The type i24 is 'Illegal' because it does not match a native x86 machine register. The Type-Legalizer has a complex set of rules for legalizing different types, and in many cases the type legalization takes multiple steps.The Type-Legalizer has a number of strategies for handling illegal vector types:&lt;ul>&lt;li> Widening - The type-legalizer can widen vectors by adding additional elements. For example, the type &amp;lt;3 x float&amp;gt; would be widened to the legal type '&amp;lt;4 x float&amp;gt;'. &lt;/li>&lt;li> Splitting - The type-legalizer can split large vectors into smaller types. For example, a value of type &amp;lt;8 x float&amp;gt; can be split into two values of the legal type '&amp;lt;4 x float&amp;gt;'.&lt;/li>&lt;li> Scalarizing - The type-legalizer can break a vector into multiple scalars. For example, an operation of type &amp;lt;2 x i64&amp;gt; can be done on two 64-bit scalars using general purpose registers. &lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Notice that none of the strategies above can translate the type '&amp;lt;4 x i1&amp;gt;' into the register-sized type '&amp;lt;4 x i32&amp;gt;'. To support the code-generation of vector-select, we added a new legalization kind which can support the promotion of each element in the vector, rather than increasing the number of elements in the vector.&lt;p>LLVM already promotes small scalar integers into larger integers. For example, the type i8 is promoted to i32 on processors that do not support types smaller than 32 bits. Once the new type legalization technique was implemented, adding support for the select instruction was easy. Much like other instructions, a simple pattern in the TD file added support for different 'blend' instructions for different generations of the Intel Architecture (SSE4.1, AVX and AVX2). Processors that do not support the 'blend' instruction, lower the vector-select IR into a sequence of AND,XOR,OR with acceptable performance. &lt;h2>Optimizations for Element Promotion&lt;/h2>&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iEM0ks4VajM/Tu8sGVUjBcI/AAAAAAAAEao/Hn4uRBVoK7s/s1600/PackedStore.png">&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5687813341706388930" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iEM0ks4VajM/Tu8sGVUjBcI/AAAAAAAAEao/Hn4uRBVoK7s/s320/PackedStore.png" style="cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; float: right; height: 132px; margin: 0 0 10px 10px; width: 320px;" />&lt;/a>The new type-legalization method for vectors and the new vector-select implementation is open for new optimizations. For example, consider the problem of saving a vector of type '&amp;lt;4 x i8&amp;gt;' into memory. The in-memory representation of this type is that of four consecutive bytes, but the vector's in-register representation is '&amp;lt;4 x i32&amp;gt;'. Without any additional optimizations, the naive way of saving the vector would be to extract each one of the bytes into a general purpose register and to save them one by one into memory. One of the optimizations that we added recently is to shuffle all of the saved bytes into the lower part of the vector and save the four bytes into memory using a single scalar 32 bit store.&lt;h2>Vectors of pointers&lt;/h2>Until recently, LLVM's vector type only contained elements which were integers or floating point. This abstraction matched the common SIMD instruction sets and enabled efficient code generation for many processors. In many cases vectorizing compilers wish to represent a vector of pointers, mainly for implementing scatter/gather memory operations. The lack of support in the IR made some vectorizing compilers worke around limitation by converting pointers to integers. This solution required the vectorizing compiler to implement address calculation manually, and added complexity to the software.&lt;p>To solve this, LLVM now supports the pointer-vector type, as well as the instructions to manipulate it. Much like other vector instructions, the pointer-vector can be created and modified using the instructions 'insertelement', 'extractelement' and 'shufflevector'. However, pointer-vector types would not be so useful without vector 'getelementptr' instructions. We extended LLVM's GEP instruction to support vectors of pointers. The new pointer-vector abstraction enables better code generation, even for processors which do not support explicit gather/scatter instructions, since address calculation is now done on vectors.The following code is now legal in LLVM:&lt;pre>define i32 @foo(&amp;lt;4 x i32*&amp;gt; %base, &amp;lt;4 x i32&amp;gt; %offset) nounwind { &lt;br/> entry: &lt;br/> %A2 = getelementptr &amp;lt;4 x i32*&amp;gt; %base, &amp;lt;4 x i32&amp;gt; %offset &lt;br/> %k = extractelement &amp;lt;4 x i32*&amp;gt; %A2, i32 3 &lt;br/> %v = load i32* %k &lt;br/> ret i32 %v &lt;br/> }&lt;/pre>We currently support only vectors of pointers to primitive types. In the future we may add additional capabilities and optimizations.&lt;h2>Conclusion&lt;/h2>Intel® OpenCL SDK features an implicit vectorization module which uses the LLVM compiler toolkit for code generation. We are continuing to improve LLVM's code generation support for vectors, in order to support future Intel Architectures.&lt;p>LLVM 3.1 will feature a number of changes that will enable vectorizing compilers to generate better code.</description></item><item><title>LLVM 3.0 Exception Handling Redesign</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2011/11/llvm-30-exception-handling-redesign.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2011 13:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2011/11/llvm-30-exception-handling-redesign.html</guid><description>
One of the biggest IR changes in the LLVM 3.0 release is a redesign and reimplementation of the LLVM IR exception handling model. The old model, while it worked for most cases, fell over in some key situations, leading to obscure miscompilations, missed optimizations, and poor compile time. This post talks about the changes in LLVM 3.0 and how to move an existing LLVM front-end to the new design. It assumes some familiarity with the Itanium C++ ABI for exception handling.&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;h2>Goals of the exception handling system&lt;/h2>Exception handling needs to be a first-class citizen of the LLVM IR. This allows us to manipulate the exception handling information in an intelligent fashion (e.g., during inlining). Also, code generation needs to be able to reliably find a variety of information associated specific &lt;tt>invoke&lt;/tt> call (e.g. the personality function for use with a call). Finally, we need to follow the established exception handling ABI to ensure binary compatibility with other compilers.&lt;p>While there are a lot of details to get right for exception handling to work (with regards to the ABI), our goal is to keep LLVM IR as simple to generate and manipulate as possible. By making EH a first-class citizen, the new instructions will have a simple, easily understood syntax and constraints which can be tested to ensure that the IR is correct after each code transformation.&lt;h2>The old exception handling system&lt;/h2>The old system used LLVM intrinsics to convey the exception handling information to the code generator. The primary problem with the old system is that there was nothing that bound these intrinsics to the invoke calls that could be unwound through, making code generation fragile, and optimizations like inlining impossible to represent (in the general case).&lt;p>Further, the intrinsics were very difficult for code transformations to maintain and update correctly: we would frequently get exception tables which had incorrect information in them (e.g., specifying that a specific type couldn't propagate past that point when it wasn't specified in the original program). It also couldn't handle "cleanup" situations without a lot of work.&lt;p>Because of normal code motion, the intrinsics, which held the information that the code generator needed to generate the correct tables, could be moved far away from the &lt;tt>invoke&lt;/tt> instruction they were associated with. I.e., they could be moved out of the &lt;tt>invoke&lt;/tt>'s landingpad. This made code generation of the previous exception handling constructs fragile, and sometimes caused miscompilations of exception handling code, which wasn't acceptable.&lt;p>A final (somewhat theoretical) issue is that the old system only worked with standard personality functions. It would be nearly impossible to use custom personality functions (e.g. that returned 3 registers in a landing pad instead of 2) with it. While we had no specific use case for this, we were unable to use custom personality functions to optimize code size or performance of C++ exceptions.&lt;h2>The LLVM 3.0 Exception Handling System&lt;/h2>The backbone of the new exception handling system are the two new instructions &lt;tt>landingpad&lt;/tt> and &lt;tt>resume&lt;/tt>:&lt;dl>&lt;dt>&lt;tt>&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#i_landingpad">landingpad&lt;/a>&lt;/tt>&lt;/dt> &lt;dd>Defines a landing pad basic block. It contains all of the information that's needed by the code generator to generate the correct EH tables. It's also required to be the first non-&lt;tt>PHI&lt;/tt> instruction in the unwind destination of an invoke instruction. In addition, a landing pad may &lt;em>only&lt;/em> be jumped to by the unwind edge of an &lt;tt>invoke&lt;/tt> instruction. These constraints ensure that it is always possible to accurately match up the unwind information with an invoke call. It replaces the&lt;tt>@llvm.eh.exception&lt;/tt> and &lt;tt>@llvm.eh.selector&lt;/tt>intrinsics.&lt;/dd>&lt;dt>&lt;tt>&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#i_resume">resume&lt;/a>&lt;/tt>&lt;/dt> &lt;dd>Causes the current exception to resume propagation up the stack. It replaces the &lt;tt>@llvm.eh.resume&lt;/tt> intrinsic.&lt;/dd>&lt;/dl>&lt;p>Here is a simple example of what the new syntax looks like. For this program:&lt;p>&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;br /> void bar();&lt;br /> void foo() throw (const char *) {&lt;br /> try {&lt;br /> bar();&lt;br /> } catch (int) {&lt;br /> }&lt;br /> }&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />The IR looks like this:&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;br /> @_ZTIPKc = external constant i8*&lt;br /> @_ZTIi = external constant i8*&lt;br /> define void @_Z3foov() uwtable ssp {&lt;br /> entry:&lt;br /> invoke void @_Z3barv()&lt;br /> to label %try.cont unwind label %lpad&lt;br />&lt;br /> lpad:&lt;br /> &lt;b>%0 = landingpad { i8*, i32 } personality i8* bitcast (i32 (...)* @__gxx_personality_v0 to i8*)&lt;br /> catch i8* bitcast (i8** @_ZTIi to i8*)&lt;br /> filter [1 x i8*] [i8* bitcast (i8** @_ZTIPKc to i8*)]&lt;/b>&lt;br /> %1 = extractvalue { i8*, i32 } %0, 0&lt;br /> %2 = extractvalue { i8*, i32 } %0, 1&lt;br /> %3 = tail call i32 @llvm.eh.typeid.for(i8* bitcast (i8** @_ZTIi to i8*)) nounwind&lt;br /> %matches = icmp eq i32 %2, %3&lt;br /> br i1 %matches, label %catch, label %filter.dispatch&lt;br />&lt;br /> filter.dispatch:&lt;br /> %ehspec.fails = icmp slt i32 %2, 0&lt;br /> br i1 %ehspec.fails, label %ehspec.unexpected, label %eh.resume&lt;br />&lt;br /> ehspec.unexpected:&lt;br /> tail call void @__cxa_call_unexpected(i8* %1) no return&lt;br /> unreachable&lt;br />&lt;br /> catch:&lt;br /> %4 = tail call i8* @__cxa_begin_catch(i8* %1) nounwind&lt;br /> tail call void @__cxa_end_catch() nounwind&lt;br /> br label %try.cont&lt;br />&lt;br /> try.cont:&lt;br /> ret void&lt;br />&lt;br /> eh.resume:&lt;br /> &lt;b>resume { i8*, i32 } %0&lt;/b>&lt;br /> }&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />The &lt;tt>landingpad&lt;/tt> instruction specifies the &lt;i>personality function&lt;/i>the EH runtime uses, a list of types which it can catch (&lt;tt>int&lt;/tt>), and a list of types which &lt;tt>foo&lt;/tt> is allowed to throw (&lt;tt>const char *&lt;/tt>).&lt;p>The &lt;tt>resume&lt;/tt> instruction resumes propagation of the exception if it's not caught and of an allowed type.&lt;h2>Converting to the LLVM 3.0 exception handling system&lt;/h2>Converting from the old EH API to the new EH API is rather simple because a lot of complexity has been removed. To generate the EH code in LLVM 2.9, you would have to do something akin to this:&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;br /> Function *ExcIntr =&lt;br /> Intrinsic::getDeclaration(TheModule, Intrinsic::eh_exception);&lt;br /> Function *SlctrIntr =&lt;br /> Intrinsic::getDeclaration(TheModule, Intrinsic::eh_selector);&lt;br /> Function *PersonalityFn =&lt;br /> Function::Create(FunctionType::get(Type::getInt32Ty(Context), true),&lt;br /> Function::ExternalLinkage,&lt;br /> "__gxx_personality_v0", TheModule);&lt;br />&lt;br /> // The exception pointer.&lt;br /> Value *ExnPtr = Builder.CreateCall(ExcIntr, "exn");&lt;br />&lt;br /> // The arguments to the @llvm.eh.selector instruction.&lt;br /> std::vector&amp;lt;Value*&amp;gt; Args; Args.push_back(ExnPtr);&lt;br /> Args.push_back(Builder.CreateBitCast(PersonalityFn,&lt;br /> Type::getInt8PtrTy(Context)));&lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;i>// ... Complex code to add catch types, filters, cleanups, and catch-alls to Args ...&lt;/i>&lt;br />&lt;br /> // The selector call.&lt;br /> Value *Sel = Builder.CreateCall(SlctrIntr, Args, "exn.sel");&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />You should instead generate a &lt;tt>landingpad&lt;/tt> instruction, that returns an exception object and selector value:&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;br /> LandingPadInst *LPadInst =&lt;br /> Builder.CreateLandingPad(StructType::get(Int8PtrTy, Int32Ty, NULL),&lt;br /> PersonalityFn, 0);&lt;br /> Value *ExnPtr = Builder.CreateExtractValue(LPadInst, 0);&lt;br /> Value *Sel = Builder.CreateExtractValue(LPadInst, 1);&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />It's now trivial to add the individual clauses to the &lt;tt>landingpad&lt;/tt>instruction.&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;br /> &lt;b>&lt;i>// Adding a catch clause&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&lt;br /> Constant *TypeInfo = getTypeInfo();&lt;br /> LPadInst-&amp;gt;addClause(TypeInfo);&lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;b>&lt;i>// Adding a C++ catch-all&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&lt;br /> LPadInst-&amp;gt;addClause(Constant::getNullValue(Builder.getInt8PtrTy()));&lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;b>&lt;i>// Adding a cleanup&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&lt;br /> LPadInst-&amp;gt;setCleanup(true);&lt;br />&lt;br /> &lt;b>&lt;i>// Adding a filter clause&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&lt;br /> std::vector&amp;lt;Value*&amp;gt; TypeInfos;&lt;br /> Constant *TypeInfo = getFilterTypeInfo();&lt;br /> TypeInfos.push_back(Builder.CreateBitCast(TypeInfo, Builder.getInt8PtrTy()));&lt;br /> ArrayType *FilterTy = ArrayType::get(Int8PtrTy, TypeInfos.size());&lt;br /> LPadInst-&amp;lt;addClause(ConstantArray::get(FilterTy, TypeInfos));&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Converting from using the &lt;tt>@llvm.eh.resume&lt;/tt> intrinsic to the &lt;tt>resume&lt;/tt> instruction is trivial. It takes the exception pointer and exception selector values returned by the &lt;tt>landingpad&lt;/tt>instruction:&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;br /> Type *UnwindDataTy = StructType::get(Builder.getInt8PtrTy(),&lt;br /> Builder.getInt32Ty(), NULL);&lt;br /> Value *UnwindData = UndefValue::get(UnwindDataTy);&lt;br /> Value *ExcPtr = Builder.CreateLoad(getExceptionObjSlot());&lt;br /> Value *ExcSel = Builder.CreateLoad(getExceptionSelSlot());&lt;br /> UnwindData = Builder.CreateInsertValue(UnwindData, ExcPtr, 0, "exc_ptr");&lt;br /> UnwindData = Builder.CreateInsertValue(UnwindData, ExcSel, 1, "exc_sel");&lt;br /> Builder.CreateResume(UnwindData);&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />&lt;h4>Conclusion&lt;/h4>The new EH system now works much better than the old system. It is much less fragile and complex. This makes it easier to understand when you have to read the IR to figure out what's going on. More importantly, it allows us to follow the ABI more closely than before.&lt;p>Better yet, it's rather straight-forward to convert from the old system to the new one. In fact, you may see your code become much simpler!

One of the most pervasive IR (and thus compiler API) changes in LLVM 3.0 was a complete reimplementation of the LLVM IR type system. This change was long overdue (the original type system lasted from LLVM 1.0!) and made the compiler faster, greatly simplified a critical subsystem of VMCore, and eliminated some design points of IR that were frequently confusing and inconvenient. This post explains why the change was made along with how the new system works. &lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;h3>Goals of the type system&lt;/h3> The &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#typesystem">LLVM IR type system&lt;/a> is a fairly straight-forward part of the IR. The type system consists of three major parts: primitive types (like 'double' and integer types), derived types (like structs, arrays and vectors), and a mechanism for handling forward declarations of types ('opaque').&lt;p> The type system has several important requirements that constrains its design: we want to be able to use efficient pointer equality checks to determine structural type equality, we want to allow late refinement of types (e.g. when linking, one module should be able to complete types in another module), we want it to be easy to express many different source languages, and we want a simple and predictable system.&lt;p> The only really difficult part of an IR type system is handling forward declarations of types. To see this, observe that the type system is actually represented with a complex graph of types (which is often cyclic). For example, a simple singly linked list of integers might be declared like this: &lt;pre>&lt;br /> %intlist = type { %intlist*, i32 }&lt;br />&lt;/pre> In this case, the type graph includes a StructType which points to an IntegerType and a PointerType. The PointerType points back to the StructType. In many real programs the graph is complex and heavily cyclic, particularly for C++ applications.&lt;p> With this as background, lets start by talking about how LLVM 2.9 and earlier worked. &lt;h3>The old type system&lt;/h3> The &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/releases/2.9/docs/LangRef.html#typesystem">LLVM 2.9&lt;/a> type system has all of the straight-forward pieces and represents forward type declarations with an instance of &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/releases/2.9/docs/LangRef.html#t_opaque">OpaqueType&lt;/a>. When this type is later resolved (e.g. at link time), a process know as "type refinement" &lt;em>updates all pointers&lt;/em> to the old OpaqueType to point to the new definition, mutating the type graph on the fly, and then deletes the original OpaqueType. For example, if a module contained: &lt;pre>&lt;br /> %T1 = type opaque&lt;br /> %T2 = type %T1*&lt;br />&lt;/pre> then T2 is a PointerType to an OpaqueType. If we resolve %T1 to {} (an empty struct), then %T2 &lt;em>mutates&lt;/em> to be a PointerType to the empty StructType. For more information on this, please see the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/releases/2.9/docs/ProgrammersManual.html#TypeResolve ">type resolution section&lt;/a> of the LLVM 2.9 Programmer's Manual.&lt;p> &lt;h4>Ramifications of mutating and moving types&lt;/h4> Unfortunately, while conceptually simple, this type system had several problems. In order to guarantee that pointer equality checks work for structural type equivalence checks, VMCore is required to re-unique types whenever they are mutated during type resolution. This may not seem like such a big deal, but a single type refinement can cause hundreds of other types to be mutated, and it is quite common to refine hundreds or thousands of types (e.g. when linking an application for LTO). The performance of this was not acceptable, particularly because uniquing cyclic graphs requires full graphic isomorphism checks to be done, and our previous implementation was not algorithmically efficient.&lt;p> Another problem is that more than just types need to be updated: anything that contains a pointer to a type has to be updated, or it gets a dangling pointer. This issue manifested in a number of ways: for example every Value has a pointer to a type. In order to make the system a bit more efficient, Value::getType() actually performed a lazy "union find" step to ensure that it always returned a canonicalized and uniqued type. This made Value::getType() (a very common call) more expensive than it should be.&lt;p> An even worse problem that this "type updating" problem caused is when you were manipulating and building IR through the LLVM APIs. Because types could move, it was very easy to get dangling pointers, causing a lot of confusion and a lot of broken clients of the LLVM API. This was compounded by the fact that it was &lt;em>required&lt;/em> to use type refinement to build &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/releases/2.9/docs/ProgrammersManual.html#BuildRecType">simple recursive types&lt;/a>. We tried to make this simpler with the PATypeHolder and PATypeHandle classes, but they only worked if you used them exactly right and they were generally poorly understood.&lt;p> &lt;h4>Surprising behavior with type uniquing&lt;/h4> Many clients of LLVM, once they got things working, then quickly ran into a surprising aspect of type uniquing: type names were not part of the type system, they were an "on the side" data structure. The names were not taking into consideration during type uniquing, and you could have multiple names for one type (which led to a lot of confusion). For example, consider: &lt;pre>&lt;br /> %T1 = type opaque&lt;br /> @G1 = external global %T1*&lt;br />&lt;br /> %T2 = type {}&lt;br /> @G2 = external global %T2*&lt;br />&lt;/pre> If %T1 was later resolved to {}, then %T1 and %T2 would both become names for the same empty structure type, the type formerly known as "%T1*" would be unified with the type formerly known as "%T2*", and now the IR would print out as: &lt;pre>&lt;br /> %T1 = type {}&lt;br /> @G1 = external global %T1*&lt;br />&lt;br /> %T2 = type {}&lt;br /> @G2 = external global %T1*&lt;br />&lt;/pre> ... note that G2 now has type "%T1*"! This is because the names in the type system was just a hash table on the side, so that asmprinter would pick one of the arbitrarily large number of names for a type when printing. This was "correct", but highly confusing the folks who did not know the ins and outs of the type system, and not helpful behavior. It also made reading .ll dumps from a C++ compiler very difficult, because it is very common to have many structurally identical types with different names. &lt;h4>Type Up-references&lt;/h4> A final problem (that I don't want to dwell on too much) is that we previously could have the situation where a type existed that had no name at all. While this is fine from the type system graph's perspective, this made printing types impossible if they were cyclic and had no names. The solution to this problem was a system known as &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/releases/2.9/docs/LangRef.html#t_uprefs">type up-references&lt;/a>.&lt;p> Type up-references were an elegant solution that allowed the asmprinter (and parser) to be able to represent an arbitrary recursive type in finite space, without requiring names. For example, the %intlist example above could be represented as "{\2*, i32}". It also allowed for construction of some nice (but surprising) types like "\1*" which was a pointer to itself!&lt;p> Despite having some amount of beauty and elegance, type up-references were never well understood by most people and caused a lot of confusion. It is important to be able to strip the names out of an LLVM IR module (e.g. the -strip pass), but it is also important for compiler hackers to be able to understand the system! &lt;h4>Preparing for the new type system&lt;/h4> With all of these problems, I realized that LLVM needed a newer and simpler type system. However, it is also important that new versions of LLVM be able to read old .bc and .ll files. To enable this, the big rewrite was carefully staged: the LLVM 2.9 asmprinter was enhanced to emit opaque types as numbered types instead of using up-references. Therefore, instead of emitting the %intlist example with up-references, LLVM 2.9 would emit it as: &lt;pre>&lt;br /> %0 = type { %0*, i32 }&lt;br />&lt;/pre> The plan for LLVM 3.0 was to drop compatibility with LLVM 2.8 (and earlier) files, so this made the "upgrade" logic needed in LLVM 3.0 much simpler. &lt;h2>The LLVM 3.0 Type System&lt;/h2> To most clients, the new type system in LLVM 3.0 looks and smells a lot like the 2.9 type system. For example, .bc files and .ll files produced by LLVM 2.9 are readable and automatically upgraded to 3.0 features when read by the bitcode reader and .ll parser (though LLVM 3.1 will drop compatibility with 2.9). This is because the type system retains almost everything it had before: the primitive and derived types are the same, only OpaqueType has been removed and StructType has been enhanced.&lt;p> In short, instead of a refinement based type system where types mutate in memory (requiring re-uniquing and moving/updating of pointers), LLVM 3.0 uses a type system very similar to what C has, based on type &lt;em>completion&lt;/em>. Basically, instead of creating an opaque type and replacing it later, you now create an StructType with no body, then specify the body later. To create the %intlist type, you'd now write something like this: &lt;pre>&lt;br /> StructType *IntList = StructType::create(SomeLLVMContext, "intlist");&lt;br /> Type *Elts[] = { PointerType::getUnqual(IntList), Int32Type };&lt;br /> IntList->setBody(Elts);&lt;br />&lt;/pre> ... which is simple and to the point, much better than &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/releases/2.9/docs/ProgrammersManual.html#BuildRecType">the 2.9 way&lt;/a>. There are a few non-obvious ramifications to this design though. &lt;h4>Only struct types can be recursive&lt;/h4> In the previous type system, an OpaqueType could be resolved to any arbitrary type, allowing such oddities as "%t1 = type %t1*", which is a pointer to itself. In the new type system, only IR structure types can have their body missing, so it is impossible to create a recursive type that doesn't involve a struct. &lt;h4>Literal and Identified structs&lt;/h4> In the new type system, there are actually two different kinds of structure type: a "literal" structure (e.g. "{i32, i32}") and an "identified" structure (e.g. "%ty = type {i32, i32}").&lt;p> Identified structures are the kind we are talking about: they can have a name, and can have their body specified after the type is created. The identified structure is not uniqued with other structure types, which is why they are produced with StructType::create(...). Because identified types are potentially recursive, the asmprinter always prints them by their name (or a number like %42 if the identified struct has no name).&lt;p> Literal structure types work similarly to the old IR structure types: they never have names and are uniqued by &lt;em>structural&lt;/em> identity: this means that they must have their body elements available at construction time, and they can never be recursive. When printed by the asmprinter, they are always printed inline without a name. Literal structure types are created by the StructType::get(...) methods, reflecting that they are uniqued (the call may or may not actually allocate a new StructType).&lt;p> We expect that identified structure types will be the most common, and that a frontend will only produce a literal structure type in special cases. For example, it is reasonable to use literal structure types for tuples, complex numbers, and other simple cases where a name would be arbitrary and would make the IR more difficult to read. The optimizer doesn't care one way or the other, so if you're the author of a front-end, just use whatever you prefer to see in your IR dumps. &lt;h4>Identified structs have a 1-1 mapping with a name&lt;/h4> Where type names were kept as an "on the side" hash table before, they are now an intrinsic part of a type, and the only types that can be named are identified structs. This means that LLVM 3.0 doesn't exhibit the previous confusing behavior where two seemingly different structs would be printed with the same name. When stripping type names from a module, the identified structs just become anonymous: they are still 'identified', but they have no name. As with other anonymous entities in LLVM IR, they are asmprinted in a numeric form. &lt;h4>Struct names are uniqued at the LLVMContext level&lt;/h4> Because StructType::create always returns a new identified type, we need some behavior for when you try to create two types with the same name. The solution is that VMCore detects the conflict and autorenames the later request by adding a suffix to the type: when you request a "foo" type, you may actually get back a type named "foo.42". This is consistent with other IR objects like instructions and functions, and the names are uniqued at the LLVMContext level. &lt;h4>The Linker "links" types and retypes IR objects&lt;/h4> An interesting aspect of this design is that it makes the IR linker's job a bit more complex. Consider what happens when you link these two IR modules together: &lt;pre>&lt;br />x.ll:&lt;br /> %A = type { i32 }&lt;br /> @G = external global %A&lt;br />y.ll:&lt;br /> %A = type { i32 }&lt;br /> @G = global %A zeroinitializer&lt;br />&lt;/pre> The first thing the linker does is load the two modules into the same LLVMContext. Since the two types named "A" &lt;em>must be different&lt;/em> types, and since there can only be one type named %A, we actually get these two modules in memory: &lt;pre>&lt;br />x.ll module:&lt;br /> %A = type { i32 }&lt;br /> @G = external global %A&lt;br />y.ll module:&lt;br /> %A.1 = type { i32 }&lt;br /> @G = global %A.1 zeroinitializer&lt;br />&lt;/pre> ... and now it is quite clear that the @G objects have different types. When linking these two global variables, it is now up to the linker to remap the types of IR objects into a consistent set of types, and rewrite things into a consistent state. This requires the linker to compute the set of identical types and solve the same graph isomorphism problems that VMCore used to (see the "remapType" logic in lib/Linker/LinkModules.cpp if you're interested).&lt;p> Putting this logic in the IR linker instead of VMCore is better that the previous design on many levels: now the cost for this merging and uniquing is only paid by the IR linker, not by all bitcode reading and other IR creation code. The code is easier to understand and algorithmically optimize, because we're merging two complete graphs at once - instead of resolving types one at a time. Finally, this shrinks the size of VMCore by moving some complex logic out of it. &lt;h4>Identifying magic IR types in the optimizer (or later)&lt;/h4> As in LLVM 2.9, type names are not really designed to be used as semantic information in IR: we expect everything to continue working if the -strip pass is used to remove all extraneous names from the IR. However, for research and other purposes, it can sometimes be a convenient hack to propagate information from a front-end into LLVM IR by using type names. This will work reliably in LLVM 3.0 (so long as you don't run the strip pass or something equivalent) because identified types aren't uniqued. However, be aware that the suffix can be added and write your code to tolerate it.&lt;p> A more robust way to be able to identify a specific type in the optimizer (or some other point after the frontend has run) is to use a named metadata node to find the type. For example, if you want to find the %foo type, you could generate IR that looks like this: &lt;pre>&lt;br /> %foo = type { ... }&lt;br /> ...&lt;br /> !magic.types = !{ %foo zeroinitializer }&lt;br />&lt;/pre> Then to find the "foo" type, you'd just look up the "magic.types" named metadata, and get the type of the first element. Even if type names are stripped or types get auto-renamed, the type of the first element will always be correct and stable.&lt;p> There seems to be some confusion around named metadata: unlike instruction-level metadata, they will &lt;b>not&lt;/b> be dropped or invalidated by optimizer passes (so long as they don't point to functions or other IR objects that are modified by the optimizer). In general, named metadata is a much, much, better way to pass information from a frontend to an optimizer or backend than trying to play games with type names. &lt;h2>Conclusion&lt;/h2> In conclusion, the new type system has solved a number of long-standing problems in LLVM IR. If you're upgrading some code from LLVM 2.x to 3.x, it is likely to be something that you'll run into. Hopefully, this helps answer some common questions about why we made the change and how it works!&lt;p> -&lt;a href="http://nondot.org/sabre/">Chris Lattner&lt;/a></description></item><item><title>Greedy Register Allocation in LLVM 3.0</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2011/09/greedy-register-allocation-in-llvm-30.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2011 21:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2011/09/greedy-register-allocation-in-llvm-30.html</guid><description>
LLVM has two new register allocators: Basic and Greedy. When LLVM 3.0 is released, the default optimizing register allocator will no longer be linear scan, but the new greedy register allocator.&lt;br />With its global live range splitting, the greedy algorithm generates code that is 1-2% smaller, and up to 10% faster than code produced by linear scan.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;h2> Lessons learned from linear scan&lt;/h2>Linear scan has been the default register allocator in LLVM since 2004. It has worked surprisingly well for such a simple algorithm. In fact, the simple design made it easier to tweak the algorithm in order to make small improvements to the generated code. More advanced register allocation algorithms often need to build expensive data structures, or they make assumptions about live ranges being invariant. That makes it difficult to, say, commute a two-address instruction on the fly, or rematerialize a constant pool load instead of spilling it to the stack.&lt;br />A new register allocation algorithm needs to preserve this simplicity. It must be possible to change the machine code while the algorithm is running.&lt;br />Linear scan depends on the virtual register rewriter to clean up the code after registers have been assigned. In theory, the rewriter should only rewrite virtual registers to their assigned physical registers, but it knows many other tricks. When linear scan does something silly like reloading a register from a stack slot twice, the rewriter will clean up the code by reusing the first register and eliminating the second reload. The algorithm is local, and it cannot clean up messes that extend beyond a single basic block. The rewriter always saves the day by removing obvious mistakes. It comes at a high price, though. It accounts for about half of the linear scan compile time, and its large collection of tricks makes the code very hard to maintain.&lt;br />A new register allocator should avoid making obvious mistakes so the rewriter can concentrate on rewriting registers.&lt;br />As the name implies, linear scan works by visiting live ranges in a linear order. It maintains an &lt;em>active list&lt;/em> of live ranges that are live at the current point in the function, and this is how it detects interference without computing the full interference graph. The active list is the key to linear scan's speed, but it is also its greatest weakness.&lt;br />When all physical registers are blocked by interfering live ranges in the active list, a live range is selected for spilling. Live ranges being spilled without being split first cause the mess that the rewriter is working so hard to clean up. We would much rather split them into smaller pieces that might be assignable, but this would require the linear scan algorithm to backtrack. This is very expensive, and full live range splitting isn't really feasible with linear scan.&lt;br />&lt;h2> Basic allocator&lt;/h2>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wd-VjahgQ7s/Uf2yGLeR9QI/AAAAAAAAAAc/Rf-W3y1fKPA/s1600/rabasic.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wd-VjahgQ7s/Uf2yGLeR9QI/AAAAAAAAAAc/Rf-W3y1fKPA/s1600/rabasic.png" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>The new basic allocator does away with linear scan's dependence on visiting live ranges in linear order. Instead, it uses a priority queue to visit live range in order of decreasing spill weight. The active list used for interference checks is replaced with a set of &lt;em>live interval unions&lt;/em>. Implemented as a B+ tree per physical register, they are an efficient way of checking for interference with already assigned live ranges. Unlike the active list, live interval unions work with any priority queue order.&lt;br />When a live range cannot be assigned to any physical register in its register class, it is spilled. Because live ranges are assigned in order of decreasing spill weight, all the interfering live ranges in the live interval union have a higher spill weight. It is not necessary to look for a better spill candidate.&lt;br />On CISC architectures, the spill slot memory accesses can often be folded into existing instructions. On RISC architectures, explicit load and store instructions must be inserted. This will also create new tiny live ranges between the spill code and the original instructions using the spilled live range. These new live ranges are put back on the priority queue with an infinite spill weight—they cannot be spilled again.&lt;br />Technically, these small live ranges with high spill weight should have been assigned first, but the basic allocator never backtracks. Therefore, it can happen that such a live range is blocked by already assigned live ranges with smaller spill weights. In that case, the allocator picks a physical register and spills the interfering live ranges assigned to that register instead.&lt;br />The basic allocator produces code very similar to linear scan's output, and it also depends on the virtual register rewriter to clean up the code for good results. It doesn't offer significant advantages over linear scan, and it is intended mostly for testing the framework of priority queues and live interval unions. The basic algorithm is very simple, and it offers many opportunities for tweaking. Greedy does just that.&lt;br />&lt;h2> Greedy allocator&lt;/h2>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4fMcjz5dFzE/Uf2yVe2AE5I/AAAAAAAAAAk/Jz0XiwrwHxA/s1600/ragreedy.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4fMcjz5dFzE/Uf2yVe2AE5I/AAAAAAAAAAk/Jz0XiwrwHxA/s1600/ragreedy.png" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>The first thing to notice about the basic algorithm is that its priority queue order doesn't work well for coloring registers optimally. Spill weights are computed as use densities, and small live ranges tend to have high spill weights. This means that all the tiny live ranges are allocated first. They use up the first registers in the register class, and the large live ranges get to fight over the leftovers. Most of them end up spilling.&lt;br />Greedy avoids this problem by allocating the large live ranges first. This makes the full register class available for the large ranges, and the small ranges can often fit in the gaps. Some functions have too many large live ranges, so there is not enough room for all the small live ranges. It would be really bad to spill small live ranges with high spill weights, so instead already assigned live ranges with lower spill weight can be evicted from the live range union. Evicted live ranges are unassigned from their physical register and put back in the priority queue. They get a second chance at being assigned somewhere else, or they can move on to &lt;em>live range splitting&lt;/em>.&lt;br />When a live range cannot find interfering live ranges it is allowed to evict, it is not spilled right away. If possible, it is split into smaller pieces that are put back on the priority queue. This is a very important optimization. A large live range may be idle a lot of the time, but used intensively in a hot loop. By creating a separate live range covering the hot loop, there is a good chance it will be assigned a register. The remaining live range may spill outside the loop where it was idle anyway. A live range is only spilled when the splitter decides that splitting it won't help. That usually happens after all the busy regions have been separated, and the remaining live range only has a few copies to and from the busy registers.&lt;br />The interaction between live range splitting and eviction creates a process of gradual refinement. As live ranges are split around busy regions, they get a higher spill weight. This may allow them to evict older live ranges that are less busy in that region. The evicted ranges are split, and so on.&lt;br />The gradual process of splitting usually terminates before the live ranges become tiny, and the end result is a set of live ranges covering multiple instructions, or even multiple basic blocks. This means that there is nothing for the rewriter to clean up, and indeed greedy uses a completely trivial rewriter that is 85 lines of code compared to 2600 in the old rewriter.&lt;br />The code generated by the greedy algorithm is almost always better than what linear scan can do. Usually this is because live range splitting was able to eliminate spill code from loops. Greedy does know some more tricks, though.&lt;br />&lt;h2> Tweaks&lt;/h2>It was an important design goal to make the algorithm as flexible as possible, and to avoid introducing arbitrary constraints. It is possible to change machine code and live ranges at any time. Simply evict the relevant live ranges, make the change, and put them back on the queue.&lt;br />This flexibility allows many tweaks to the register allocator:&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>Register preferences. Function arguments are passed in specific physical registers defined by the ABI. LLVM represents this with copies between physical and virtual registers before and after function calls. The register allocator tries to assign the virtual registers to the same physical registers, so the copies can be eliminated. Linear scan was never really good at this—the preferred physical register had often been occupied by an earlier assignment. Greedy can simply evict the earlier assignment when that happens.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Prefer small encodings. On architectures like ARM Thumb2 and x86-64, some registers require a larger instruction encoding. Greedy will evict less important live ranges from the cheap registers before it assigns an expensive register. This means that the larger instruction encodings are used less often, and overall code size decreases.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Dead code elimination. Optimizations like rematerialization cause live ranges to be shorter, or even completely unused. Greedy will recompute the live ranges exactly, and recursively eliminate dead code.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Register class inflation. Live range splitting creates virtual registers that are used by fewer instructions. This sometimes lifts a constraint, so the virtual register can be moved to a larger register class. Depending on the architecture, this can double the number of registers available to the new live range.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>The greedy register allocator still has lots of room for improvement. That was the whole point of replacing linear scan.</description></item><item><title>LLVM @ "The Architecture of Open Source Applications"</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/llvm-architecture-of-open-source.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2011 20:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/llvm-architecture-of-open-source.html</guid><description>

Google has one of the largest monolithic C++ codebases in the world. We have thousands of engineers working on millions of lines of C++ code every day. To help keep the entire thing running and all these engineers fast and productive we have had to build some unique C++ tools, centering around the Clang C++ compiler. These help engineers understand their code and prevent bugs before they get to our production systems.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;i>(Cross-posted on the &lt;a href="http://google-engtools.blogspot.com/2011/05/c-at-google-here-be-dragons.html">Google Engineering Tools Blog&lt;/a>)&lt;/i>&lt;br />&lt;br />Of course, improving the speed of Google engineers—their productivity—doesn’t always correlate to &lt;i>speed&lt;/i> in the traditional sense. It requires the holistic acceleration of Google’s engineering efforts. Making any one tool faster just doesn’t cut it; the entire process has to be improved from end to end.&lt;br />&lt;br />As a performance junkie, I like to think of this in familiar terms. It’s analogous to an &lt;b>algorithmic&lt;/b> performance improvement. You get “algorithmic” improvements in productivity when you reduce the total work required for an engineer to get the job done, or fundamentally shift the time scale that the work requires. However, improving the time a single task requires often runs afoul of all the adages about performance tuning, 80/20 rules, and the pitfalls of over-optimizing.&lt;br />&lt;br />One of the best ways to get these algorithmic improvements to productivity is to completely remove a set of tasks. Let’s take the task of triaging and debugging serious production bugs. If you’ve worked on a large software project, you’ve probably seen bugs which are somehow missed during code review, testing, and QA. When these bugs make it to production they cause a massive drain on developer productivity as the engineers cope with outages, data loss, and user complaints.&lt;br />&lt;br />What if we could build a tool that would find these exact kinds of bugs in software automatically? What if we could prevent them from ever bringing down a server, reaching a user’s data, or causing a pager to go off? Many of these bugs boil down to simple C++ programming errors. Consider this snippet of code:&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;br />Response ProcessRequest(Widget foo, Whatsit bar, bool *charge_acct) {&lt;br /> // Do some fancy stuff...&lt;br /> if (/* Detect a subscription user */) {&lt;br /> charge_acct = false;&lt;br /> }&lt;br /> // Lots more fancy stuff...&lt;br />}&lt;/pre>&lt;br />&lt;br />Do you see the bug? Careful testing and code reviews catch these and other bugs constantly, but inevitably one will sneak through, because the code &lt;b>looks fine&lt;/b>. It says that it shouldn’t charge the account right there, plain as day. Unfortunately, C++ insists that ‘false’ is the same as ‘0’ which can be a pointer just as easily as it can be a boolean flag. This code sets the pointer to NULL, and never touches the flag.&lt;br />&lt;br />Humans aren’t good at spotting this type of devious typo, any more than humans are good at translating C++ code into machine instructions. We have tools to do that, and the tool of choice in this case is the compiler. Not just any compiler will do, because while the code above is &lt;em>one&lt;/em> example of a bug, we need to teach our compiler to find lots of other examples. We also have to be careful to make certain that developers will act upon the information these tools provide. Within Google’s C++ codebase, that means we break the build for every compiler diagnostic, even warnings. We continually need to enhance our tools to find new bugs in new code based on new patterns, all while maintaining enough precision to immediately break the build and have high confidence that the code is wrong.&lt;br />&lt;br />To address these issues we started a project at Google which is working with the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM Project&lt;/a> to develop the &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang&lt;/a> C++ compiler. We can rapidly add warnings to Clang and customize them to emit precise diagnostics about dangerous and potentially buggy constructs. Clang is designed as a collection of libraries with the express goal of supporting diverse tools and application uses. These libraries can be directly integrated into IDEs and commandline tools while still forming the core of the compiler itself.&lt;br />&lt;br />We’ve been working on Clang for over a year now so that it can understand and reason about all of the C++ code at Google. But building the tools and technology to catch these bugs is only half the battle; we have to get engineers to &lt;em>use&lt;/em> them as well. When other teams at Google respond to production bugs, our team will often begin working to enable any Clang diagnostics that might have caught the bug. Within one week of production issues, we can sweep the entire code base using these diagnostics to fix any latent bugs.&lt;br />&lt;br />Recently we enabled the Clang C++ compiler for every C++ build at Google in order to provide accurate and helpful warnings and diagnostics to engineers. Some examples of how Clang can help developers with bad code are discussed on &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/amazing-feats-of-clang-error-recovery.html"> this post&lt;/a> to the LLVM blog. Beyond that, once we have swept the codebase with a bug-finding diagnostic, we can enable it for all our engineers to catch future bugs before they’re committed. These diagnostics break the entire build of that piece of software to ensure that they aren’t ignored and are acted on immediately. For the code sample above, the user gets an error message:&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;br />&lt;b>example1.cc:4:17: error: initialization of pointer of type 'bool *' from literal 'false' [-Werror,-Wbool-conversions]&lt;/b>&lt;br /> charge_acct = false;&lt;br /> &lt;b>^&lt;/b>&lt;/pre>&lt;br />&lt;br />Here are two other classes of bugs we’ve found::&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;br />long kMaxDiskSpace = 10 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 30; // Ten gigs ought to be enough for anybody.&lt;br />&lt;br />void SomeService() {&lt;br /> // Setup task using external resource...&lt;br /> while (/* Check if resource is available yet ... */) {&lt;br /> sleep(0.5); // Yield the CPU&lt;br /> }&lt;br />}&lt;/pre>&lt;br />&lt;br />Which now trigger the following errors:&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;br />&lt;b>example2.cc:12:25: error: shift result (10737418240) requires 35 bits to represent, but 'int' only has 32 bits [-Werror,-Wshift-overflow]&lt;/b>&lt;br />long kMaxDiskSpace = 10 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 30;&lt;br /> &lt;b>~~ ^ ~~&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;b>example2.cc:16:11: error: implicit conversion turns literal floating-point number into integer: 'double' to 'unsigned int' [-Werror,-Wliteral-conversion]&lt;/b>&lt;br /> sleep(0.5);&lt;br /> &lt;b>~~~~~ ^~~&lt;/b>&lt;/pre>&lt;br />&lt;br />All of these represent real bugs that we have found in our code, and that we are catching and fixing with the help of Clang today.&lt;br />&lt;br />Clang and its diagnostics don’t in any way obviate the need for careful code review and thorough testing. Rather, they complement these practices, combining to help reduce the number of bugs in our code. This is the platform on which we are developing new and better diagnostics for engineers going forward. This is how we are providing an algorithmic improvement to their productivity, and accelerating Google.&lt;br />&lt;br />Stay tuned for more posts about how we rolled Clang out to Google engineers, how we have enhanced Clang to make it even more relevant for our code and our developers’ needs, and some of the exciting tools we’re building on top of this platform.</description></item><item><title>What Every C Programmer Should Know About Undefined Behavior #3/3</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know_21.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 May 2011 00:48:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know_21.html</guid><description>
In &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html">Part 1&lt;/a> of the series, we took a look at undefined behavior in C and showed some cases where it allows C to be more performant than "safe" languages. In &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know_14.html">Part 2&lt;/a>, we looked at the surprising bugs this causes and some widely held misconceptions that many programmers have about C. In this article, we look at the challenges that compilers face in providing warnings about these gotchas, and talk about some of the features and tools that LLVM and Clang provide to help get the performance wins, while taking away some of the surprise.&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br /> Translation available in: &lt;a href="http://blog-ja.intransient.info/2011/06/c-33.html">Japanese&lt;/a> &lt;h2>Why can't you warn when optimizing based on undefined behavior?&lt;/h2>&lt;br />People often ask why the compiler doesn't produce warnings when it is taking advantage of undefined behavior to do an optimization, since any such case might actually be a bug in the user code. The challenges with this approach are that it is 1) likely to generate far too many warnings to be useful - because these optimizations kick in all the time when there is no bug, 2) it is really tricky to generate these warnings only when people want them, and 3) we have no good way to express (to the user) how a series of optimizations combined to expose the opportunity being optimized. Lets take each of these in turn:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>It is "really hard" to make it actually useful&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />Lets look at an example: even though invalid type casting bugs are frequently exposed by type based alias analysis, it would not be useful to produce a warning that "the optimizer is assuming that P and P[i] don't alias" when optimizing "zero_array" (from &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html">Part #1 of our series&lt;/a>).&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>float *P;&lt;br /> void zero_array() {&lt;br /> int i;&lt;br /> for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; 10000; ++i)&lt;br /> P[i] = 0.0f;&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Beyond this "false positive" problem, a logistical problem is that the optimizer doesn't have enough information to generate a reasonable warning. First of all, it is working on an already-abstract representation of the code (&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM IR&lt;/a>) which is quite different from C, and second, the compiler is highly layered to the point where the optimization trying to "hoist a load from P out of the loop" doesn't know that TBAA was the analysis that resolved the pointer alias query. Yes, this is "the compiler guy whining" part of the article :), but it really is a hard problem.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>It is hard to generate these warnings &lt;i>only&lt;/i> when people want them&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />Clang implements numerous warnings for simple and obvious cases of undefined behavior, such as out of range shifts like "x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 421". You might think that this is a simple and obvious thing, but it turns out that this is hard, because &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=5544">people don't want to get warnings about undefined behavior in dead code&lt;/a> (see also &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=6933">the duplicates&lt;/a>).&lt;br />&lt;br />This dead code can take several forms: a macro that expands out in a funny way when when passed a constant, we've even had complaints that we warn in cases that would require &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=9322">control flow analysis&lt;/a> of switch statements to prove that cases are not reachable. This is not helped by the fact that switch statements in C are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff's_device">not necessarily properly structured&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />The solution to this in Clang is a growing infrastructure for handling "runtime behavior" warnings, along with code to prune these out so that they are not reported if we later find out that the block is unexecutable. This is something of an arms race with programmers though, because there are always idioms that we don't anticipate, and doing this sort of thing in the frontend means that it doesn't catch every case people would want it to catch.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Explaining a series of optimizations that exposed an opportunity&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />If the frontend has challenges producing good warnings, perhaps we can generate them &lt;em>from the optimizer&lt;/em> instead! The biggest problem with producing a useful warning here is one of data tracking. A compiler optimizer includes dozens of optimization passes that each change the code as it comes through to canonicalize it or (hopefully) make it run faster. If the inliner decides to inline a function, this may expose other opportunities for &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html#signed_overflow">optimizing away an "X*2/2"&lt;/a>, for example.&lt;br />&lt;br />While I've given &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html#optimizations">relatively simple and self-contained examples&lt;/a> to demonstrate these optimizations, most of the cases where they kick in are in code coming from macro instantiation, inlining, and other abstraction-elimination activities the compiler performs. The reality is that humans don't commonly write such silly things directly. For warnings, this means that in order to relay back the issue to the users code, the warning would have to reconstruct exactly how the compiler got the intermediate code it is working on. We'd need the ability to say something like:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;blockquote>&lt;tt>&lt;br />warning: after 3 levels of inlining (potentially across files with Link Time Optimization), some common subexpression elimination, after hoisting this thing out of a loop and proving that these 13 pointers don't alias, we found a case where you're doing something undefined. This could either be because there is a bug in your code, or because you have macros and inlining and the invalid code is dynamically unreachable but we can't prove that it is dead.&lt;/tt>&lt;/blockquote>&lt;br />Unfortunately, we simply don't have the internal tracking infrastructure to produce this, and even if we did, the compiler doesn't have a user interface good enough to express this to the programmer.&lt;br />&lt;br />Ultimately, undefined behavior is valuable to the optimizer because it is saying "this operation is invalid - you can assume it never happens". In a case like "*P" this gives the optimizer the ability to reason that P cannot be NULL. In a case like "*NULL" (say, after some constant propagation and inlining), this allows the optimizer to know that the code must not be reachable. The important wrinkle here is that, because it cannot solve the halting problem, the compiler cannot know whether code is actually dead (as the C standard says it must be) or whether it is a bug that was exposed after a (potentially long) series of optimizations. Because there isn't a generally good way to distinguish the two, almost all of the warnings produced would be false positives (noise).&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Clang's Approach to Handling Undefined Behavior&lt;/h2>&lt;br />Given the sorry state that we're in when it comes to undefined behavior, you might be wondering what Clang and LLVM are doing to try to improve the situation. I mentioned a couple of them already: the &lt;a href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/">Clang Static Analyzer&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://klee.llvm.org/">Klee project&lt;/a>, and the &lt;tt>-fcatch-undefined-behavior&lt;/tt> flag are useful tools for tracking down some classes of these bugs. The problem is that these aren't as widely used as the compiler is, so anything we can do directly in the compiler offers even higher goodness than doing it in these other tools. Keep in mind though that the compiler is limited by not having dynamic information and by being limited to what it can without burning lots of compile time.&lt;br />&lt;br />Clang's first step to improve the world's code is to turn on a whole lot more warnings by default than other compilers do. While some developers are disciplined and build with "&lt;tt>-Wall -Wextra&lt;/tt>" (for example), many people don't know about these flags or don't bother to pass them. Turning more warnings on by default catches more bugs more of the time.&lt;br />&lt;br />The second step is that Clang generates warnings for many classes of undefined behavior (including dereference of null, oversized shifts, etc) that are obvious in the code to catch some common mistakes. Some of the caveats are mentioned above, but these seem to work well in practice.&lt;br />&lt;br />The third step is that the LLVM optimizer generally takes much less liberty with undefined behavior than it could. Though the standard says that any instance of undefined behavior has completely unbound effects on the program, this is not a particularly useful or developer friendly behavior to take advantage of. Instead, the LLVM optimizer handles these optimizations in a few different ways (the links describe rules of LLVM IR, not C, sorry!):&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>Some cases of undefined behavior are silently transformed into implicitly trapping operations if there is a good way to do that. For example, with Clang, this C++ function:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>int *foo(long x) {&lt;br /> return new int[x];&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />compiles into this X86-64 machine code:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>__Z3fool:&lt;br /> movl $4, %ecx&lt;br /> movq %rdi, %rax&lt;br /> mulq %rcx&lt;br /> movq $-1, %rdi # Set the size to -1 on overflow&lt;br /> cmovnoq %rax, %rdi # Which causes 'new' to throw std::bad_alloc&lt;br /> jmp __Znam&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />instead of the code GCC produces:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>__Z3fool:&lt;br /> salq $2, %rdi&lt;br /> jmp __Znam # Security bug on overflow!&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />The difference here is that we've decided to invest a few cycles in preventing a potentially &lt;a href="http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/advisories/calloc.php">serious integer overflow bug&lt;/a> that can lead to buffer overflows and exploits (operator new is typically fairly expensive, so the overhead is almost never noticable). The GCC folks have been aware of this &lt;a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19351">since at least 2005&lt;/a> but haven't fixed this at the time of this writing.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Arithmetic that &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#undefvalues">operates on undefined values&lt;/a> is considered to produce a undefined value instead of producing undefined behavior. The distinction is that undefined values can't format your hard drive or produce other undesirable effects. A useful refinement happens in cases where the arithmetic would produce the same output bits given any possible instance of the undefined value. For example, the optimizer assumes that the result of "undef &amp;amp; 1" has zeros for its top bits, treating only the low bit as undefined. This means that ((undef &amp;amp; 1) &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1) is defined to be 0 in LLVM, not undefined.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Arithmetic that dynamically executes an undefined operation (such as a signed integer overflow) generates a logical &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#trapvalues">trap value&lt;/a> which poisons any computation based on it, but that does not destroy your entire program. This means that logic downstream from the undefined operation may be affected, but that your entire program isn't destroyed. This is why the optimizer ends up deleting code that operates on uninitialized variables, for example.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Stores to null and calls through null pointers are turned into a __builtin_trap() call (which turns into a trapping instruction like "ud2" on x86). These happen all of the time in optimized code (as the result of other transformations like inlining and constant propagation) and we used to just delete the blocks that contained them because they were "obviously unreachable".&lt;br />&lt;br />While (from a pedantic language lawyer standpoint) this is strictly true, we quickly learned that people do occasionally dereference null pointers, and having the code execution just fall into the top of the next function makes it very difficult to understand the problem. From the performance angle, the most important aspect of exposing these is to squash downstream code. Because of this, clang turns these into a runtime trap: if one of these is actually dynamically reached, the program stops immediately and can be debugged. The drawback of doing this is that we slightly bloat code by having these operations and having the conditions that control their predicates.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The optimizer does go to some effort to "do the right thing" when it is obvious what the programmer meant (such as code that does "*(int*)P" when P is a pointer to float). This helps in many common cases, but you really don't want to rely on this, and there are lots of examples that you might think are "obvious" that aren't after a long series of transformations have been applied to your code.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Optimizations that don't fall into any of these categories, such the zero_array and set/call examples in Part #1 are optimized as described, silently, without any indication to the user. We do this because we don't have anything useful to say, and it is very uncommon for (buggy) real-world code to be broken by these optimizations.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;br />One major area of improvement we can make is with respect to trap insertion. I think it would be interesting to add an (off-by-default) warning flag that would cause the optimizer to warn whenever it generates a trap instruction. This would be extremely noisy for some codebases, but could be useful for others. The first limiting factor here is the infrastructure work to make the optimizer produce warnings: it doesn't have useful source code location information unless debugging information is turned on (but this could be fixed).&lt;br />&lt;br />The other, more significant, limiting factor is that the warning wouldn't have any of the "tracking" information to be able to explain that an operation is the result of unrolling a loop three times and inlining it through four levels of function calls. At best we'll be able to point out the file/line/column of the original operation, which will be useful in the most trivial cases, but is likely to be extremely confusing in other cases. In any event, this hasn't been a high priority for us to implement because a) it isn't likely to give a good experience b) we won't be able to turn it on by default, and c) is a lot of work to implement.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Using a Safer Dialect of C (and other options)&lt;/h2>&lt;br />A final option you have if you don't care about "ultimate performance", is to use various compiler flags to enable dialects of C that eliminate these undefined behaviors. For example, using the &lt;tt>-fwrapv&lt;/tt> flag eliminates undefined behavior that results from signed integer overflow (however, note that it does &lt;b>not&lt;/b> eliminate possible integer overflow security vulnerabilities). The &lt;tt>-fno-strict-aliasing&lt;/tt> flag disables Type Based Alias Analysis, so you are free to ignore these type rules. If there was demand, we could add a flag to Clang that implicitly zeros all local variables, one that inserts an "and" operation before each shift with a variable shift count, etc. Unfortunately, there is no tractable way to &lt;b>completely&lt;/b> eliminate undefined behavior from C without breaking the ABI and completely destroying its performance. The other problem with this is that you're not writing C anymore, you're writing a similar, but non-portable dialect of C.&lt;br />&lt;br />If writing code in a non-portable dialect of C isn't your thing, then the &lt;tt>-ftrapv&lt;/tt> and &lt;tt>-fcatch-undefined-behavior&lt;/tt> flags (along with the other tools mentioned before) can be useful weapons in your arsenal to track down these sorts of bugs. Enabling them in your debug builds can be a great way to find related bugs early. These flags can also be useful in production code if you are building security critical applications. While they provide no guarantee that they will find all bugs, they do find a useful subset of bugs.&lt;br />&lt;br />Ultimately, the real problem here is that C just isn't a "safe" language and that (despite its success and popularity) many people do not really understand how the language works. In its decades of evolution prior to standardization in 1989, C migrated from being a "low level systems programming language that was a tiny layer above PDP assembly" to being a "low level systems programming language, trying to provide decent performance by &lt;em>breaking many people's expectations&lt;/em>". On the one hand, these C "cheats" almost always work and code is generally more performant because of it (and in some cases, &lt;em>much&lt;/em> more performant). On the other hand, the places where C cheats are often some of the most surprising to people and typically strike at the worst possible time.&lt;br />&lt;br />C is much more than a portable assembler, sometimes in very surprising ways. I hope this discussion helps explain some of the issues behind undefined behavior in C, at least from a compiler implementer's viewpoint.&lt;br />&lt;br />-&lt;a href="http://nondot.org/sabre/">Chris Lattner&lt;/a></description></item><item><title>What Every C Programmer Should Know About Undefined Behavior #2/3</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know_14.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2011 12:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know_14.html</guid><description>
In &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html">Part 1&lt;/a> of our series, we discussed what undefined behavior is, and how it allows C and C++ compilers to produce higher performance applications than "safe" languages. This post talks about how "unsafe" C really is, explaining some of the highly surprising effects that undefined behavior can cause. In &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know_21.html">Part #3&lt;/a>, we talk about what friendly compilers can do to mitigate some of the surprise, even if they aren't required to. &lt;br />&lt;br />I like to call this "&lt;b>Why undefined behavior is often a scary and terrible thing for C programmers&lt;/b>". :-)&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br /> Translation available in: &lt;a href="http://blog-ja.intransient.info/2011/05/c-23.html">Japanese&lt;/a> &lt;h2>Interacting Compiler Optimizations Lead to Surprising Results&lt;/h2>&lt;br />A modern compiler optimizer contains many optimizations that are run in specific orders, sometimes iterated, and change as the compiler evolves over time (e.g. new releases come out). Also, different compilers often have substantially different optimizers. Because optimizations run at different stages, emergent effects can occur due to previous optimizations changing the code.&lt;br />&lt;br />Lets take a look at a silly example (simplified from an exploitable bug that was found in the Linux Kernel) to make this more concrete:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>void contains_null_check(int *P) {&lt;br /> int dead = *P;&lt;br /> if (P == 0)&lt;br /> return;&lt;br /> *P = 4;&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />In this example, the code "clearly" checks for the null pointer. If the compiler happens to run "Dead Code Elimination" before a "Redundant Null Check Elimination" pass, then we'd see the code evolve in these two steps:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>void contains_null_check_after_DCE(int *P) {&lt;br /> &lt;strike>//int dead = *P;&lt;/strike> // deleted by the optimizer.&lt;br /> if (P == 0)&lt;br /> return;&lt;br /> *P = 4;&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />and then:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>void contains_null_check_after_DCE_and_RNCE(int *P) {&lt;br /> if (P == 0) // Null check not redundant, and is kept.&lt;br /> return;&lt;br /> *P = 4;&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />However, if the optimizer happens to be structured differently, it could run RNCE before DCE. This would give us these two steps:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>void contains_null_check_after_RNCE(int *P) {&lt;br /> int dead = *P;&lt;br /> if (&lt;b>false&lt;/b>) // P was dereferenced by this point, so it can't be null &lt;br /> return;&lt;br /> *P = 4;&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />and then dead code elimination runs:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>void contains_null_check_after_RNCE_and_DCE(int *P) {&lt;br /> &lt;strike>//int dead = *P;&lt;/strike>&lt;br /> &lt;strike>//if (false)&lt;/strike>&lt;br /> &lt;strike>// return;&lt;/strike>&lt;br /> *P = 4;&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />To many (reasonable!) programmers, deleting the null check from this function would be very surprising (and they'd probably file a bug against the compiler :). However, both "contains_null_check_after_DCE_and_RNCE" and "contains_null_check_after_RNCE_and_DCE" are perfectly valid optimized forms of "contains_null_check" according to the standard, and both of the optimizations involved are important for the performance of various applications.&lt;br />&lt;br />While this is intentionally a simple and contrived example, this sort of thing happens all the time with inlining: inlining a function often exposes a number of secondary optimization opportunities. This means that if the optimizer decides to inline a function, a variety of local optimizations can kick in, which change the behavior of the code. This is both perfectly valid according to the standard, and important for performance in practice.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Undefined Behavior and Security Don't Mix Well&lt;/h2>&lt;br />The C family of programming languages is used to write a wide range of security critical code, such as kernels, setuid daemons, web browsers, and much more. This code is exposed to hostile input and bugs can lead to all sorts of exploitable security problems. One of the widely cited advantages of C is that it is relatively easy to understand what is going on when you read the code.&lt;br />&lt;br />However, undefined behavior takes this property away. After all, most programmers would think that "contains_null_check" would do a null check above. While this case isn't too scary (the code will probably crash in the store if passed a null check, which is relatively easy to debug) there are a wide range of &lt;i>very reasonable&lt;/i> looking C fragments that are completely invalid. This problem has bit many projects (including the Linux Kernel, OpenSSL, glibc, etc) and even led to CERT issuing a &lt;a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/162289">vulnerability note&lt;/a> against GCC (though my personal belief is that all widely-used optimizing C compilers are vulnerable to this, not just GCC).&lt;br />&lt;br />Lets look at an example. Consider this carefully written C code:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>void process_something(int size) {&lt;br /> // Catch integer overflow.&lt;br /> if (size &amp;gt; size+1)&lt;br /> abort();&lt;br /> ...&lt;br /> // Error checking from this code elided.&lt;br /> char *string = malloc(size+1);&lt;br /> read(fd, string, size);&lt;br /> string[size] = 0;&lt;br /> do_something(string);&lt;br /> free(string);&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>This code is checking to make sure that the malloc is big enough to hold the data read from the file (because a nul terminator byte needs to be added), bailing out if an integer overflow error occurs. However, this is &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html#signed_overflow">exactly the example we gave before&lt;/a> in which the compiler is allowed to (validly) optimize out the check. This means that it is perfectly possible for the compiler to turn this into:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>void process_something(int *data, int size) {&lt;br /> char *string = malloc(size+1);&lt;br /> read(fd, string, size);&lt;br /> string[size] = 0;&lt;br /> do_something(string);&lt;br /> free(string);&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />When being built on a 64-bit platform, it is quite likely that this is an exploitable bug when "size" is INT_MAX (perhaps the size of a file on disk). Lets consider how terrible this is: a code auditor reading the code would very reasonably think that a proper overflow check is happening. Someone testing the code would find no problem unless they specifically tested that error path. The secure code seems to work, until someone goes ahead and exploits the vulnerability. All in all, this is a surprising and quite scary class of bugs. Fortunately, the fix is simple in this case: just use "size == INT_MAX" or similar.&lt;br />&lt;br />As it turns out, integer overflow is a security problem for many reasons. Even if you are using fully defined integer arithmetic (either by using &lt;tt>-fwrapv&lt;/tt> or by using unsigned integers), there is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow#Security_ramifications">wholly different class&lt;/a> of integer overflow bug possible. Fortunately, this class is visible in the code and knowledgable security auditors are usually aware of the problem.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Debugging Optimized Code May Not Make Any Sense&lt;/h2>Some people (for example, low level embedded programmers who like to look at generated machine code) do all of their development with optimizations turned on. Because code &lt;b>frequently&lt;/b> has bugs when it is being developed, these folks end up seeing a disproportionate number of surprising optimizations that can lead to difficult-to-debug behaviors at runtime. For example, accidentally leaving out the "i = 0" in the "zero_array" example from the first article allows the compiler to completely discard the loop (compiling zero_array into "return;") because it is a use of an uninitialized variable.&lt;br />&lt;br />Another interesting case that bit someone recently happened when they had a (global) function pointer. A simplified example looks like this:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>static void (*FP)() = 0;&lt;br />static void impl() {&lt;br /> printf("hello\n");&lt;br />}&lt;br />void set() {&lt;br /> FP = impl;&lt;br />}&lt;br />void call() {&lt;br /> FP();&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>which clang optimizes into:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>void set() {}&lt;br />void call() {&lt;br /> printf("hello\n");&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>It is allowed to do this because calling a null pointer is undefined, which permits it to assume that set() must be called before call(). In this case, the developer forgot to call "set", did not crash with a null pointer dereference, and their code broke when someone else did a debug build.&lt;br />&lt;br />The upshot is that it is a fixable issue: if you suspect something weird is going on like this, try building at -O0, where the compiler is much less likely to be doing any optimizations at all.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>"Working" code that uses undefined behavior can "break" as the compiler evolves or changes &lt;/h2>We've seen many cases where applications that "appear to be work" suddenly break when a newer LLVM is used to build it, or when the application was moved from GCC to LLVM. While LLVM does occasionally have a bug or two itself :-), this is most often because of latent bugs in the application that are now being exposed by the compiler. This can happen all sorts different ways, two examples are:&lt;br />&lt;br />1. an uninitialized variable which was zero initialized by luck "before", and now it shares some other register that isn't zero. This is commonly exposed by register allocation changes.&lt;br />&lt;br />2. an array overflow on the stack which starts clobbering a variable that actually matters, instead of something that was dead. This is exposed when the compiler rearranges how it packs things on the stack, or gets more aggressive about sharing stack space for values with non-overlapping lifetimes.&lt;br />&lt;br />The important and scary thing to realize is that just about *any* optimization based on undefined behavior can start being triggered on buggy code at any time in the future. Inlining, loop unrolling, memory promotion and other optimizations will keep getting better, and a significant part of their reason for existing is to expose secondary optimizations like the ones above.&lt;br />&lt;br />To me, this is deeply dissatisfying, partially because the compiler inevitably ends up getting blamed, but also because it means that huge bodies of C code are land mines just waiting to explode. This is even worse because...&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>There is No Reliable Way to Determine if a Large Codebase Contains Undefined Behavior&lt;/h2>Making the landmine a much much worse place to be is the fact that there is &lt;b>no good way&lt;/b> to determine whether a large scale application is free of undefined behavior, and thus not susceptible to breaking in the future. There are many useful tools that can help find &lt;b>some&lt;/b> of the bugs, but nothing that gives full confidence that your code won't break in the future. Lets look at some of these options, along with their strengths and weaknesses:&lt;br />&lt;br />1. The &lt;a href="http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://valgrind.org/info/tools.html#memcheck">memcheck tool&lt;/a> is a fantastic way to find all sorts of uninitialized variables and other memory bugs. Valgrind is limited because it is quite slow, it can only find bugs that still exist in the generated machine code (so it &lt;a href="http://blog.regehr.org/archives/519">can't find things the optimizer removes&lt;/a>), and doesn't know that the source language is C (so it can't find shift-out-of-range or signed integer overflow bugs).&lt;br />&lt;br />2. Clang has an experimental &lt;tt>-fcatch-undefined-behavior&lt;/tt> mode that inserts runtime checks to find violations like shift amounts out of range, some simple array out of range errors, etc. This is limited because it slows down the application's runtime and it can't help you with random pointer dereferences (like Valgrind can), but it can find other important bugs. Clang also fully supports the &lt;tt>-ftrapv&lt;/tt> flag (not to be confused with &lt;tt>-fwrapv&lt;/tt>) which causes signed integer overflow bugs to trap at runtime (GCC also has this flag, but it is completely unreliable/buggy in my experience). Here is a quick demo of &lt;tt>-fcatch-undefined-behavior&lt;/tt>:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ cat t.c&lt;br />int foo(int i) {&lt;br /> int x[2];&lt;br /> x[i] = 12;&lt;br /> return x[i];&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />int main() {&lt;br /> return foo(2);&lt;br />}&lt;br />$ clang t.c &lt;br />$ ./a.out &lt;br />$ clang t.c -fcatch-undefined-behavior &lt;br />$ ./a.out &lt;br />Illegal instruction&lt;br />&lt;/pre>3. Compiler warning messages are good for finding some classes of these bugs, like uninitialized variables and simple integer overflow bugs. It has two primary limitations: 1) it has no dynamic information about your code as it executes, and 2) it must run very quickly because any analysis it does slows down compile time.&lt;br />&lt;br />4. &lt;a href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/">The Clang Static Analyzer&lt;/a> performs a much deeper analysis to try to find bugs (including use of undefined behavior, like null pointer dereferences). You can think of it as generating souped up compiler warning messages, because it is not bound by the compile time constraints of normal warnings. The primary disadvantages of the static analyzer is that it 1) doesn't have dynamic information about your program as it runs, and 2) is not integrated into normal workflows for many developers (though its integration into &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/snowleopard/static.html">Xcode 3.2 and later&lt;/a> is fantastic). &lt;br />&lt;br />5. The &lt;a href="http://klee.llvm.org/">LLVM "Klee" Subproject&lt;/a> uses symbolic analysis to "try every possible path" through a piece of code to find bugs in the code and it &lt;b>produces a testcase&lt;/b>. It is a great little project that is mostly limited by not being practical to run on large-scale applications.&lt;br />&lt;br />6. While I have never tried it, the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/c-semantics/">C-Semantics tool&lt;/a> by Chucky Ellison and Grigore Rosu is a very interesting tool that can apparently find some classes of bugs (such as sequence point violations). It is still a research prototype, but may be useful for finding bugs in (small and self-contained) programs. I recommend reading &lt;a href="http://blog.regehr.org/archives/523">John Regehr's post about it&lt;/a> for more information.&lt;br />&lt;br />The end result of this is that we have lots of tools in the toolbox to find some bugs, but no good way to prove that an application is free of undefined behavior. Given that there are lots of bugs in real world applications and that C is used for a broad range of critical applications, this is pretty scary. In our &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know_21.html">final article&lt;/a>, I look at various options that C compilers have when dealing with undefined behavior, with a specific focus on &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />-&lt;a href="http://nondot.org/sabre/">Chris Lattner&lt;/a></description></item><item><title>What Every C Programmer Should Know About Undefined Behavior #1/3</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2011 11:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html</guid><description>
People occasionally ask why LLVM-compiled code sometimes generates SIGTRAP signals when the optimizer is turned on. After digging in, they find that Clang generated a "ud2" instruction (assuming X86 code) - the same as is generated by __builtin_trap(). There are several issues at work here, all centering around undefined behavior in C code and how LLVM handles it.&lt;br />&lt;br />This blog post (the first in a series of three) tries to explain some of these issues so that you can better understand the tradeoffs and complexities involved, and perhaps learn a few more of the dark sides of C. It turns out that C is &lt;i>not&lt;/i> a "high level assembler" like many experienced C programmers (particularly folks with a low-level focus) like to think, and that C++ and Objective-C have directly inherited plenty of issues from it.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;h2>Introduction to Undefined Behavior&lt;/h2>&lt;br />Translation available in: &lt;a href="http://blog-ja.intransient.info/2011/05/c-13.html">Japanese&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;br />Both LLVM IR and the C programming language have the concept of "undefined behavior". Undefined behavior is a broad topic with a lot of nuances. The best introduction I've found to it is a post on &lt;a href="http://blog.regehr.org/archives/213">John Regehr's Blog&lt;/a>. The short version of this excellent article is that many seemingly reasonable things in C actually have undefined behavior, and this is a common source of bugs in programs. Beyond that, any undefined behavior in C gives license to the implementation (the compiler and runtime) to produce code that formats your hard drive, does completely unexpected things, &lt;a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/N/nasal-demons.html">or worse&lt;/a>. Again, I would highly recommend reading &lt;a href="http://blog.regehr.org/archives/213">John's article&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />Undefined behavior exists in C-based languages because the designers of C wanted it to be an extremely efficient low-level programming language. In contrast, languages like Java (and many other 'safe' languages) have eschewed undefined behavior because they want safe and reproducible behavior across implementations, and willing to sacrifice performance to get it. While neither is "the right goal to aim for," if you're a C programmer you really should understand what undefined behavior is.&lt;br />&lt;br />Before getting into the details, it is worth briefly mentioning what it takes for a compiler to get good performance out a broad range of C apps, because &lt;b>there is no magic bullet&lt;/b>. At a very high level, compilers produce high performance apps by a) doing a good job at bread and butter algorithms like register allocation, scheduling, etc. b) knowing lots and lots of "tricks" (e.g. peephole optimizations, loop transformations, etc), and applying them whenever profitable. c) being good at eliminating unnecessary abstractions (e.g. redundancy due to macros in C, inlining functions, eliminating temporary objects in C++, etc) and d) not screwing anything up. While any of the optimizations below may sound trivial, it turns out that saving just one cycle out of a critical loop can make some codec run 10% faster or take 10% less power.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2 id="optimizations">Advantages of Undefined Behavior in C, with Examples&lt;/h2>&lt;br />Before getting into the dark side of undefined behavior and LLVM's policy and behavior when used as a C compiler, I thought it would be helpful to consider a few specific cases of undefined behavior, and talk about how each enables better performance than a safe language like Java. You can look at this either as "optimizations enabled" by the class of undefined behavior or as the "overhead avoided" that would be required to make each case defined. While the compiler optimizer could eliminate some of these overheads some of the time, to do so in general (for every case) would require solving the halting problem and many other "interesting challenges".&lt;br />&lt;br />It is also worth pointing out that both Clang and GCC nail down a few behaviors that the C standard leaves undefined. The things I'll describe are both undefined according to the standard and treated as undefined behavior by both of these compilers in their default modes.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Use of an uninitialized variable:&lt;/b> This is commonly known as source of problems in C programs and there are many tools to catch these: from compiler warnings to static and dynamic analyzers. This improves performance by not requiring that all variables be zero initialized when they come into scope (as Java does). For most scalar variables, this would cause little overhead, but stack arrays and malloc'd memory would incur a memset of the storage, which could be quite costly, particularly since the storage is usually completely overwritten.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b id="signed_overflow">Signed integer overflow:&lt;/b> If arithmetic on an 'int' type (for example) overflows, the result is undefined. One example is that "INT_MAX+1" is not guaranteed to be INT_MIN. This behavior enables certain classes of optimizations that are important for some code. For example, knowing that INT_MAX+1 is undefined allows optimizing "X+1 &amp;gt; X" to "true". Knowing the multiplication "cannot" overflow (because doing so would be undefined) allows optimizing "X*2/2" to "X". While these may seem trivial, these sorts of things are commonly exposed by inlining and macro expansion. A more important optimization that this allows is for "&amp;lt;=" loops like this:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>for (i = 0; i &amp;lt;= N; ++i) { ... }&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />In this loop, the compiler can assume that the loop will iterate exactly N+1 times if "i" is undefined on overflow, which allows a broad range of loop optimizations to kick in. On the other hand, if the variable is defined to wrap around on overflow, then the compiler must assume that the loop is possibly infinite (which happens if N is INT_MAX) - which then disables these important loop optimizations. This particularly affects 64-bit platforms since so much code uses "int" as induction variables.&lt;br />&lt;br />It is worth noting that unsigned overflow is guaranteed to be defined as 2's complement (wrapping) overflow, so you can always use them. The cost to making signed integer overflow defined is that these sorts of optimizations are simply lost (for example, a common symptom is a ton of sign extensions inside of loops on 64-bit targets). Both Clang and GCC accept the "-fwrapv" flag which forces the compiler to treat signed integer overflow as defined (other than divide of INT_MIN by -1).&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Oversized Shift Amounts:&lt;/b> Shifting a uint32_t by 32 or more bits is undefined. My guess is that this originated because the underlying shift operations on various CPUs do different things with this: for example, X86 truncates 32-bit shift amount to 5 bits (so a shift by 32-bits is the same as a shift by 0-bits), but PowerPC truncates 32-bit shift amounts to 6 bits (so a shift by 32 produces zero). Because of these hardware differences, the behavior is completely undefined by C (thus shifting by 32-bits on PowerPC could format your hard drive, it is &lt;b>*not*&lt;/b> guaranteed to produce zero). The cost of eliminating this undefined behavior is that the compiler would have to emit an extra operation (like an 'and') for variable shifts, which would make them twice as expensive on common CPUs.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Dereferences of Wild Pointers and Out of Bounds Array Accesses:&lt;/b> Dereferencing random pointers (like NULL, pointers to free'd memory, etc) and the special case of accessing an array out of bounds is a common bug in C applications which hopefully needs no explanation. To eliminate this source of undefined behavior, array accesses would have to each be range checked, and the ABI would have to be changed to make sure that range information follows around any pointers that could be subject to pointer arithmetic. This would have an extremely high cost for many numerical and other applications, as well as breaking binary compatibility with every existing C library.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Dereferencing a NULL Pointer:&lt;/b> contrary to popular belief, dereferencing a null pointer in C is undefined. It is &lt;i>not defined to trap&lt;/i>, and if you mmap a page at 0, it is &lt;i>not defined to access that page&lt;/i>. This falls out of the rules that forbid dereferencing wild pointers and the use of NULL as a sentinel. NULL pointer dereferences being undefined enables a broad range of optimizations: in contrast, Java makes it invalid for the compiler to move a side-effecting operation across any object pointer dereference that cannot be proven by the optimizer to be non-null. This significantly punishes scheduling and other optimizations. In C-based languages, NULL being undefined enables a large number of simple scalar optimizations that are exposed as a result of macro expansion and inlining.&lt;br />&lt;br />If you're using an LLVM-based compiler, you can dereference a "volatile" null pointer to get a crash if that's what you're looking for, since volatile loads and stores are generally not touched by the optimizer. There is currently no flag that enables random NULL pointer loads to be treated as valid accesses or to make random loads know that their pointer is "allowed to be null".&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Violating Type Rules:&lt;/b> It is undefined behavior to cast an int* to a float* and dereference it (accessing the "int" as if it were a "float"). C requires that these sorts of type conversions happen through memcpy: using pointer casts is not correct and undefined behavior results. The rules for this are quite nuanced and I don't want to go into the details here (there is an exception for char*, vectors have special properties, unions change things, etc). This behavior enables an analysis known as "Type-Based Alias Analysis" (TBAA) which is used by a broad range of memory access optimizations in the compiler, and can significantly improve performance of the generated code. For example, this rule allows clang to optimize this function:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>float *P;&lt;br /> void zero_array() {&lt;br /> int i;&lt;br /> for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; 10000; ++i)&lt;br /> P[i] = 0.0f;&lt;br /> }&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />into "&lt;tt>memset(P, 0, 40000)&lt;/tt>". This optimization also allows many loads to be hoisted out of loops, common subexpressions to be eliminated, etc. This class of undefined behavior can be disabled by passing the -fno-strict-aliasing flag, which disallows this analysis. When this flag is passed, Clang is required to compile this loop into 10000 4-byte stores (which is several times slower), because it has to assume that it is possible for any of the stores to change the value of P, as in something like this:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>int main() {&lt;br /> P = (float*)&amp;amp;P; // cast causes TBAA violation in zero_array.&lt;br /> zero_array();&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />This sort of type abuse is pretty uncommon, which is why the standard committee decided that the significant performance wins were worth the unexpected result for "reasonable" type casts. It is worth pointing out that Java gets the benefits of type-based optimizations without these drawbacks because it doesn't have unsafe pointer casting in the language at all.&lt;br />&lt;br />Anyway, I hope that this gives you an idea of some of the classes of optimizations enabled by undefined behavior in C. There are many other kinds of course, including sequence point violations like "foo(i, ++i)", race conditions in multithreaded programs, violating 'restrict', divide by zero, etc.&lt;br />&lt;br />In our &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know_14.html">next post&lt;/a>, we'll discuss why undefined behavior in C is a pretty scary thing if performance is not your only goal. In our final post in the series, we'll talk about how LLVM and Clang handle it.&lt;br />&lt;br />-&lt;a href="http://nondot.org/sabre/">Chris Lattner&lt;/a></description></item><item><title>Regular Expression Commands</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2011/04/regular-expression-commands.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2011 10:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2011/04/regular-expression-commands.html</guid><description>
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'lucida grande';"> Greetings LLDB users. I want to start writing regular blog posts for the new and cool features and things you can do in LLDB. Today I will start with one that was just added: regular expression commands.&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;div>&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'lucida grande';">&lt;br />&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'lucida grande';">&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'lucida grande';">&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'lucida grande';">&lt;br />What is a regular expression command? It is a smart alias to other commands that you can define using the "&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'lucida grande';">command regex" &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'lucida grande';">command.

New in version 0.96, the ClamAV antivirus system extends its internal bytecode interpreter to support an LLVM JIT compiler. This JIT compiler allows for improved execution speeds, but also provides the ability to write virus checks directly in C code.

&lt;a href="http://tce.cs.tut.fi/">TTA-based Codesign Environment&lt;/a> (TCE) is an application-specific instruction-set processor (ASIP) design toolset developed in &lt;a href="http://www.tut.fi/">Tampere University of Technology&lt;/a> in several research projects since 2003. This blog post introduces the project and how LLVM is used in it to provide high-level language compiler support for the designed ASIPs.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size:medium;">The use case for application-specific processors&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />Especially in embedded devices so called general purpose "off-the-shelf processors" are often not optimal for the application at hand. The readily available processors might be too large in chip area, might consume too much power, might be too expensive (for a mass product) or are not running the set of programs fast enough. In order to tackle the performance problem, a common design choice is to run parts of the application in software while speeding up the performance critical functions with a custom hand-tailored hardware accelerator or a co-processor implemented as an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit">application-specific integrated circuit&lt;/a> (ASIC).&lt;br />&lt;br />The design, implementation and verification time of the hardware accelerators costs money and lengthens the time-to-market for the designed device. In addition, a fixed function hardware accelerator designed with an hardware description language (HDL) such as VHDL or Verilog has the problem of being "carved in stone", thus not providing programmability that enables late bug fixes and on-the-field updates to the supported set of functions.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fpga">Field-Programmable Gate Arrays&lt;/a> (FPGAs) allow reconfiguring the implemented hardware logic on the field. However, as FPGA is only an hardware design implementation technique, the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-recurring_engineering">non-recurring engineering cost&lt;/a>" of designing the hardware logic in an HDL is still there.&lt;br />&lt;br />Application-specific processors can be spotted in the "design space" between off-the-shelf processors, such as ARM products or Texas Instruments DSPs where functionality is described fully in software by the designer, and custom fixed function hardware accelerators where functionality is described fully in hardware description language by the designer. In case of ASIPs, the engineer is able to design both software and hardware at the same time (co-design) and is free to the choose the level of application specialization applied to the processor.&lt;br />&lt;br />What can be customized in an ASIP depends on the used processor template. A commonly customized part of the processor is the instruction set. Customizable instruction set allows the designer to define new application specific instructions for the processor to implement the desired functionality faster than a set of basic software operations such as additions or shifts can. Examples of such special instructions include complex arithmetic, non-standard floating point arithmetic, application-specific precision fixed point arithmetic, more than two input adders, etc.&lt;br />&lt;br />TCE places few restrictions on the types of custom instructions that can be added to the processor design. For example, there are no limits to the number of input operands or produced results nor the number of clock cycles the operation can execute. In addition to the custom operations, the number and size of the register files (RF), the number and type of the functional units (FU) and the connectivity between the RFs and FUs can be freely customized.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size:medium;">About Transport Triggered Architectures&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />TCE is based on a simple but scalable architecture template called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_triggered_architecture">Transport Triggered Architecture&lt;/a> (TTA, not to be confused with "Time Triggered Architecture"). TTA can be described as an exposed datapath VLIW architecture. The "exposed datapath" part means that the data transports that take place between the functional units (e.g. arithmetic logic unit or a multiplier) and the register files are explicitly visible to the programmer. In other words, while processors are commonly programmed by defining which operations to execute (including information of the sources of the operands and the destinations of the results), TTA is programmed by defining the transports of the operands and results. The name TTA comes from the way operations are executed: when operand data is moved to the triggering port of the functional unit, the operation starts executing. After a fixed latency (from the architecture point of view) the results can be read from the output ports of the functional unit to the next destination.&lt;br />&lt;br />The programming model can be illustrated more easily with an assembly code snippet example.&lt;br />&lt;br />1) &lt;span style="font-style: italic;">Traditional "operation triggered" (first parameter is the destination)&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>ADD R1, R2, R3&lt;/li>&lt;li>MUL R4, R1, R5&lt;br />&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;br />2) &lt;span style="font-style: italic;">Transport triggered&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>R2 -&amp;gt; ADD.OPERAND, R3 -&amp;gt; ADD.TRIGGER&lt;/li>&lt;li>ADD.RESULT -&amp;gt; R1&lt;/li>&lt;li>R1 -&amp;gt; MUL.OPERAND, R5 -&amp;gt; MUL.TRIGGER&lt;/li>&lt;li>MUL.RESULT -&amp;gt; R4&lt;br />&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>Transport programming enables some specific software optimizations such as software (register) bypassing which in turn can enable "dead result read elimination", that can be applied in case all result reads can be transported directly to the destination functional units. This can lead to reduced register (file) pressure. An example follows:&lt;br />&lt;br />3. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;">Transport triggered with software bypassing and dead result read elimination&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>R2 -&amp;gt; ADD.OPERAND, R3 -&amp;gt; ADD.TRIGGER&lt;/li>&lt;li>ADD.RESULT -&amp;gt; MUL.OPERAND, R5 -&amp;gt; MUL.TRIGGER&lt;/li>&lt;li>MUL.RESULT -&amp;gt; R4&lt;br />&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>Here the result from the adder is copied directly to the operand input port of the multiplier, thus removing the need for the general purpose register R1 used as a temporary storage. In addition to reducing register pressure, the freedom to schedule the movement of operand/result data in multiple cycles reduces the register file port pressure, which is one of the TTA's main motivations. In the traditional VLIW the number of RF ports needs to be scaled according to the number of connected functional units and their worst case RF port requirements (maximum simultaneous operand reads and result writes), leading to more complex RFs with higher delay and area.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size:medium;">Toolset assisted processor design with TCE&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />Designing new processors from the scratch is not a straightforward task. One needs to take care of the design, verification and porting a high level language programming toolchain for each of the processors so the programmers are happy (writing peculiar assembler syntax for a changing target would get quite depressing quickly!). Thus, the design process should be automated as fully as possible to make experimenting with different processor architecture alternatives feasible.&lt;br />&lt;br />The ultimate goal for an ASIP design toolset is to be as easy to use as taking a high-level language program as input and producing as a result an optimal processor implementation in VHDL or Verilog. It should parallelize the program for the processor's resources efficiently while exploiting custom instructions intelligently without any user intervention. In our experience, this type of fully automated "design space exploration" tends not to produce good enough results as the codesign process is often something that a human can do more efficiently. For example, sometimes the software needs to be refactored to a form that can exploit instruction level parallelism better. Sometimes it can be hard, or even impossible, for a software algorithm to realize that a complex-looking loop can be replaced with a simple single cycle custom instruction if implemented in hardware, and so on. Thus, we see that the realistic use case for an ASIP design toolset is to assist in the design task as much as possible while still leaving leeway for the engineer to exploit their knowledge in the field of algorithms or hardware design. This way, in case the engineer is skilled enough and the toolset assisting the ASIP design task is flexible enough, the processor design can eventually reach the performance of a fixed function hardware accelerator, while the design process can also be stopped at any point when the result is good enough.&lt;br />&lt;br />TCE is at a relatively mature state, providing graphical tools to design the TTA architectures, architecture description driven instruction set simulators, a retargetable compiler, and a processor implementation generator supporting VHDL output. Because TCE uses TTA, a static ILP architecture, as its processor template, the efficiency of the end result is highly dependent on an efficient compiler. The compiler has been our main focus in recent years and will most likely be in the future also.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size:medium;">LLVM in TCE&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />We were introduced to the LLVM project at about 2006. Until that point we used an old gcc v2.7.0 compiler ported from MOVE, the toolset preceeding TCE. It goes without saying that maintaining such an ancient piece of gcc code was quite a challenge and we actively tried to look for something easier to work with.&lt;br />&lt;br />In addition to a clean C++-based code base, one of the main things that lured us towards LLVM from a purely gcc-based compiler were the interprocedural optimizations. Interprocedural optimizations are very useful for us as we work with standalone (no operating system with a runtime linker assumed) fully linked programs. In fact, our compiler toolchain does not currently include any linker at all but inputs fully linked LLVM bitcodes to its code generation phase. This means that most programs benefit from the LLVM global optimizations such as aggressive inlining and dead code elimination as the externally visible interface in the compiled programs can be limited merely to the startup functions.&lt;br />&lt;br />After poking around and doing some experimental TTA code generation prototyping with LLVM (I think LLVM was at version 1.7 or so at that point) we noted that LLVM was getting more and more traction and started to look for a proper way for using LLVM for parts of the TCE code generation process.&lt;br />&lt;br />As described previously, our target, on top of being customizable, is transport triggered, thus nothing like any other architecture supported by LLVM. This caused some trial-and-error coding efforts while figuring out the best way of taking advantage of the existing code base of LLVM while still supporting instruction scheduling that exploits the special trickery and the extra scheduling freedom enabled by TTA. Another requirement, the automated retargeting of the LLVM backend for the resources of different designed processors caused some long work days to get functioning robustly.&lt;br />&lt;br />In the end, we came up with a plugin based backend approach. TCE code generation chain now includes a tool that generates LLVM backends from our XML-format architecture description files, compiles them with a C++ compiler to a dynamic library, and loads the generated LLVM backend on the fly during the code generation. At this point each TTA is modeled as a simple operation triggered architecture so the supported instruction set and registers can be described in the TableGen format. This way we could use the LLVM instruction selection and register allocation code, but the resulting sequential code is not yet something we can execute in a TTA. To finalize the code generation, after LLVM register allocation we convert the MachineInstructions to another internal representation (CFG+DDG with moves as the graph nodes) and do the rest of the code generation and TTA-specific optimizations on the TCE side.&lt;br />&lt;br />The main missing piece for us in LLVM code generation framework is a VLIW-type instruction scheduler. In case of TTA which is a statically scheduled architecture with programmer visible operation latencies, the compiler instruction scheduling is not merely an optimization that can be optionally executed to get more performance. It's fully up to the compiler to schedule the operations in such a way that the operations are not started too early (in case a previous operation is executing) nor the results read too soon (in case the operation has not yet finished). Thus, in our case, the instruction scheduling is actually mandatory to get correct results. Also, in order to exploit the instruction level parallelism in an architecture like TTA or VLIW, one needs a way to bundle multiple instructions (in our case data transport moves) in a single wide instruction (or "a cycle") to be executed in parallel. Finally, a way to model the processor resources (with resource tables or similar) during scheduling is needed to produce correct code in the absence of structural hazard detection.&lt;br />&lt;br />It would be really nice to have such a VLIW-style scheduling framework in LLVM so we could move more of our code generation to LLVM-side. Unfortunately due to a lack of time, we have not yet started to work on this as our existing instruction scheduler does the job well enough when starting from the "sequential RISC-like operation triggered" output from the LLVM code generation.&lt;br />&lt;br />In general, LLVM and it core developers have been a pleasure to work with and we hope to be able to contribute to the LLVM project more in the future. Keep up the good work!&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size:medium;">Future work and final words&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />Currently we are looking into GPGPU-style workload compilation issues. We are experimenting with OpenCL to describe the applications for easier extraction of parallelism while still providing clean support for calling custom operations from the kernel code. There is also work ongoing to extend TCE to better support task level parallelism with multicore ASIP generation and compiler assisted multithreading.&lt;br />&lt;br />In case you got interested in the project or have questions to ask, please join the mailing list &lt;a href="http://tce.cs.tut.fi/index.php/discussion">tce-users@cs.tut.fi&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />I hope to see you there!&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-style: italic;">--Pekka Jääskeläinen,&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-style: italic;font-size:x-small;" >a researcher that has been working in the TCE project from the start.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size:medium;">&lt;/span></description></item><item><title>New "lldb" Debugger</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/06/new-lldb-debugger.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jun 2010 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/06/new-lldb-debugger.html</guid><description>
I'm happy to announce a great new subproject of LLVM: LLDB. LLDB is a modern debugger infrastructure which is built (like the rest of LLVM) as a series of modular and reusable libraries. LLDB builds on existing LLVM technologies like the &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2010/01/x86-disassembler.html">enhanced disassembler&lt;/a> APIs, the Clang ASTs and expression parser, the LLVM code generator and JIT compiler.&lt;br />&lt;br />While still in early development, LLDB supports basic command line debugging scenarios on the Mac, is scriptable, and has great support for multithreaded debugging. LLDB is already much faster than GDB when debugging large programs, and has the promise to provide a much better user experience (particularly for C++ programmers). We are excited to see the new platforms, new features, and enhancements that the broader LLVM community is interested in.&lt;br />&lt;br />If you'd like to try out LLDB and participate in its development, please visit &lt;a href="http://lldb.llvm.org/">http://lldb.llvm.org/&lt;/a> and consider signing up for the &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/lldb-dev">lldb-dev&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/mailman/listinfo/lldb-commits">lldb-commits&lt;/a> mailing lists.&lt;br />&lt;br />-Chris and the LLDB Team</description></item><item><title>LLVM receives first ever SIGPLAN Software Systems Award</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/06/llvm-receives-first-ever-sigplan.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jun 2010 23:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/06/llvm-receives-first-ever-sigplan.html</guid><description>

&lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost&lt;/a> is a collection of open-source, peer-reviewed C++ libraries that's well-known for having many good utility components for C++ programmers. It's also well-known for using bleeding-edge C++ techniques, such as extensive template and preprocessor metaprogramming, that have pushed many C++ compilers beyond their breaking point. Beyond just being a library, Boost has become a benchmark and a selling point for C++ compilers: is your compiler standards-confomant enough to build Boost?&lt;br />&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Clang is.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>This morning, Clang++ had its first fully-successful Boost regression test run, passing every applicable C++ test on the Boost release branch [*]. According to today's &lt;a href="http://www.boost.org/development/tests/release/developer/summary.html">results&lt;/a>, Clang is successfully compiling more of Boost than other, established compilers for which Boost has historically been tailored (through various workarounds and configuration switches). In fact, Clang's &lt;a href="http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/branches/release/boost/config/compiler/clang.hpp">compiler configuration&lt;/a> in Boost is completely free of any of Boost's C++98/03 defect macros.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;div>As for the specifics: tests were run on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) with Clang targeting x86-64, debug build of Boost with the Clang toolset and a Release build of Clang from Subversion trunk.&lt;br />&lt;div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>If you want to try Boost with Clang, first &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html">get Clang from Subversion&lt;/a> trunk and then &lt;a href="https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/wiki/BoostSubversion">get Boost from Subversion&lt;/a> (the release branch is most stable) and edit your &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:'courier new';">~/user-config.jam&lt;/span> file by adding the following line:&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:'courier new';"> using clang ;&lt;/span>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>assuming that "clang++" is in your path.

If you read the LLVM 2.7 release notes carefully you would have noticed that one of the new external users is the &lt;a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc">Glasgow Haskell Compiler&lt;/a> (GHC). As the author of the &lt;a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Commentary/Compiler/Backends/LLVM">LLVM backend for GHC&lt;/a>, I have been invited to write a post detailing the design of the backend and my experiences with using LLVM. This is that post :).&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;br />I began work on the backend around July last year, undertaking it as part of an honours thesis for my bachelor of Computer Science. Currently the backend is quite stable and capable on Linux x86, able to bootstrap GHC itself. Other platforms haven't received any attention yet.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>What is GHC and Haskell&lt;br />&lt;/h2>GHC is a compiler for Haskell, a standardized, lazy, functional programming language. Haskell supports features such as static typing with type inference, lazy evaluation, pattern matching, list comprehension, type classes and type polymorphism. GHC is the most popular Haskell compiler, it compiles Haskell to native code and is supported of X86, PowerPC and SPARC.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Existing pipeline&lt;/h2>Before the LLVM backend was added, GHC already supported two backends, a C code generator and a native code generator (NCG).&lt;br />&lt;br />The C code generator was the first backend implemented and it works pretty well but is slow and fragile due to its use of many GCC specific extensions and need to post processes the assembly code produced by GCC to implement optimisations which aren't possible to do in the C code. The native code generator was started later to avoid these problems. It is around 2-3x quicker than the C backend and generally reduces the runtime of a Haskell program by around 5%. GHC developers are hoping to depreciate the C backend in the next major release.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Why an LLVM backend?&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;em>Offload work&lt;/em>: Building a high performance compiler backend is a huge amount of work, LLVM for example was started around 10 years ago. Going forward, the LLVM backend should be a lot less work to maintain and extend than either the C backend or NCG. It will also benefit from any future improvements to LLVM.&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;em>Optimisation passes&lt;/em>: GHC does a great job of producing fast Haskell programs. However, there are a large number of lower level optimisations (particularly the kind that require machine specific knowledge) that it doesn't currently implement. Using LLVM should give us most of them for free.&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;em>The LLVM Framework&lt;/em>: Perhaps the most appealing feature of LLVM is that it has been designed from the start to be a compiler framework. For researchers like the GHC developers, this is a great benefit and makes LLVM a very fun playground. For example, within a couple of days of the public release of the LLVM backend one developer, Don Stewart, wrote a genetic algorithm to find the best LLVM optimisation pipeline to use for various Haskell programs (you can find his blog post about this &lt;a href="http://donsbot.wordpress.com/2010/03/01/evolving-faster-haskell-programs-now-with-llvm/">here&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&lt;h2>Show me the speed&lt;/h2>That's enough reasoning for now though, lets instead jump right in and see GHC's LLVM backend in action. I'll also use this opportunity to do a little Haskell promoting as well, so you've been warned :).&lt;br />&lt;br />For a nice simple &lt;a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;amp;id=14">problem&lt;/a> to solve lets find the starting number under 1 million that generates the longest &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hailstone_sequence">hailstone sequence&lt;/a>. The hailstone sequence is a number sequence generated from a starting number n by the following rules:&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>if n is even, the next number is n/2&lt;/li>&lt;li>if n is odd, the next number is 3n + 1&lt;/li>&lt;li>if n is 1, stop.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Here is a solution in both C and Haskell:&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;code>&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;br />&lt;br />int main(int argc, char **argv) {&lt;br /> int longest = 0, terms = 0, this_terms = 1, i;&lt;br /> unsigned long j;&lt;br />&lt;br /> for (i = 1; i &amp;lt; 1000000; i++) {&lt;br /> j = i;&lt;br /> this_terms = 1;&lt;br />&lt;br /> while (j != 1) {&lt;br /> this_terms++;&lt;br /> j = j % 2 == 0 ? j / 2 : 3 * j + 1;&lt;br /> }&lt;br />&lt;br /> if (this_terms &amp;gt; terms) {&lt;br /> terms = this_terms;&lt;br /> longest = i;&lt;br /> }&lt;br /> }&lt;br /> printf("longest: %d (%d)\n", longest, terms);&lt;br /> return 0;&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />--------&lt;br />&lt;br />import Data.Word&lt;br />&lt;br />collatzLen :: Int -&amp;gt; Word32 -&amp;gt; Int&lt;br />collatzLen c 1 = c&lt;br />collatzLen c n | n `mod` 2 == 0 = collatzLen (c+1) $ n `div` 2&lt;br /> | otherwise = collatzLen (c+1) $ 3*n+1&lt;br />&lt;br />pmax x n = x `max` (collatzLen 1 n, n)&lt;br />&lt;br />main = print . solve $ 1000000&lt;br /> where solve xs = foldl pmax (1,1) [2..xs-1]&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Compiling the Haskell solution with the various backend gives the following runtime:&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;em>GHC-6.13 (NCG)&lt;/em>: 2.876s&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;em>GHC-6.13 (C)&lt;/em>: 0.576s&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;em>GHC-6.13 (LLVM)&lt;/em>: 0.516s&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;em>Clang-1.1&lt;/em>: 0.526s&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;em>GCC-4.4.3&lt;/em>: 0.335s&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Pretty great results for LLVM, it's the fastest backend of the three! The NCG performs quite badly in this case, despite my claim it usually outperforms the C backend. Recently when the GHC developers posted a message to the mailing list detailing plans to depreciate the C code generator due to the ongoing maintenance problems. A few GHC users responded, providing examples where the C code generator easily outperformed the native code generator as it does above. Thankfully for all those cases the LLVM backend does even better.&lt;br />&lt;br />One of the reasons I went with this example program is that I wanted to show off Haskell a little by demonstrating how easy it is to parallelize the solution:&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;br />&lt;code>&lt;br />import Control.Parallel&lt;br />import Data.Word&lt;br />&lt;br />collatzLen :: Int -&amp;gt; Word32 -&amp;gt; Int&lt;br />collatzLen c 1 = c&lt;br />collatzLen c n | n `mod` 2 == 0 = collatzLen (c+1) $ n `div` 2&lt;br /> | otherwise = collatzLen (c+1) $ 3*n+1&lt;br />&lt;br />pmax x n = x `max` (collatzLen 1 n, n)&lt;br />main = print soln&lt;br /> where&lt;br /> solve xs = foldl pmax (1,1) xs&lt;br /> s1 = solve [2..500000]&lt;br /> s2 = solve [500001..999999]&lt;br /> soln = s2 `par` (s1 `pseq` max s1 s2)&lt;br />&lt;/code>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />That's all! We simply divide the problem into two parts and combine them using Haskell's 'par' and 'pseq' constructs that tell the compiler to run the two parts 's1' and 's2' in parallel. And the run time (using LLVM of course):&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;em>GHC-6.13 (Parallel, LLVM)&lt;/em>: 0.312&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Great! We're even beating C here. Sure this is a very easy problem to parallelize but its still pretty cool.&lt;br />&lt;br />Finally, lets look at a bigger and more 'realistic' program and see how the LLVM backend performs. For this we will use HRay, a ray tracer implemented in Haskell. Using it to generate the image below we get the following run times:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Br4acuar1QM/S-OxB5nGI1I/AAAAAAAAAP4/qRIcxsMsx6Q/s1600/mirror.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}">&lt;img alt="Ray Traced Image" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468409018760700754" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Br4acuar1QM/S-OxB5nGI1I/AAAAAAAAAP4/qRIcxsMsx6Q/s400/mirror.jpg" style="cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 306px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px;" />&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>&lt;em>GHC (NCG):&lt;/em> 29.499&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;em>GHC (C):&lt;/em> 29.043&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;em>GHC (LLVM):&lt;/em> 20.774&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>A 30% reduction in run time with LLVM!&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Backend overview&lt;/h2>Lets look quickly at the job that the LLVM backend has to perform. GHC uses two major intermediate representations for compiling Haskell, the first being Core. Core is a functional language, basically a form of typed lambda calculus and its in this form that GHC does most of its optimisation work. There is also a IR called STG, its very similar to Core but is slightly easier to work with for procedural code generation.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Br4acuar1QM/S-OwnYREOZI/AAAAAAAAAPw/2ZELH-agCFU/s1600/pipeline.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}">&lt;img alt="" border="0" ghc="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468408563133331858" pipeline"="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Br4acuar1QM/S-OwnYREOZI/AAAAAAAAAPw/2ZELH-agCFU/s400/pipeline.png" style="cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 98px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px;" />&lt;/a>&lt;br />The second major IR is C minus minus (Cmm), which is low level imperative language designed to act as an interface between the high level Haskell compiler parts and the low level code generation. Cmm as a language is quite similar to LLVM in terms of design and feature set (e.g both use bit types such as i32...). The syntax is quite different though with Cmm looking a little like C and LLVM looking like assembly. The similarity of the two shouldn't really come as much of a surprise since they are both positioned at the same point in a compiler pipeline and also because Cmm is mostly a subset of the &lt;a href="http://www.cminusminus.org/">C--&lt;/a> language. C-- is a language designed by one of the primary GHC developers (Simon Peyton Jones) and others to act as a universal IR for compiler writers to target, very much like LLVM. (The research focus of C-- was quite different from LLVM though, C-- was designed to try to solve the problem of supporting high level language features like garbage collection and exceptions in a universal language with zero overhead. LLVM seems to be focused on supporting aggressive optimisation of a universal language). The C-- project never managed to take off like LLVM did though and so now Cmm simply serves as a good IR for GHC backends to work with.&lt;br />&lt;br />The LLVM backend fits into the GHC pipeline after Cmm, so its job is to compile from Cmm to LLVM Assembly. This is mostly straight forward because of the similarity of the two languages.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>The new calling convention&lt;/h2>There was one major challenge though in writing the backend where LLVM didn't provide the features needed to properly implement Haskell and so I needed to extend LLVM. This extension is the new calling convention I wrote of at the start of the post and to explain why its necessary we'll have to look very briefly at the execution model for Haskell used by GHC.&lt;br />&lt;br />GHC defines an abstract machine that implements the execution model for Haskell code. This is called the 'STG Machine' (or Spineless Tagless G-Machine) and its job is to evaluate the final, functional IR used by GHC, STG. The STG machine consists of three main parts, registers, a stack and a heap. For this stack, GHC doesn't use the standard C stack but implements its own. What we are concerned with though is just how the registers are implemented. The easiest method is to just store them all in memory as a structure and indeed GHC supports this method (its refereed to as 'unregistered mode' and is used for easier porting of GHC). However because of how often they are accessed a far more efficient way to implement them is to map them onto real hardware registers, which roughly halves the runtime of a typical Haskell program. So this is what GHC does, although as there are far too many STG machine registers to map onto real registers, it has to still store some of them in memory.&lt;br />&lt;br />This is a problem for the LLVM backend though as it has no control over the register allocation. We can still create a working backend by only supporting 'unregistered mode' but this isn't very useful due to the poor performance. Also we aren't just focused on performance, compatibility with the other backends is a major concern. We need to support the same register mapping as they use so that Haskell code compiled by LLVM will be able to link with code compiled by the other backends. Lets look quickly at how the other backends achieve this register mapping.&lt;br />&lt;br />With the native code generator its very straight forward since it has full control over the register allocation. How about the C backend though? Typically this would be a problem for C as well since it offers no control over register allocation. Thankfully GCC offers an extension, '&lt;a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.5.0/gcc/Global-Reg-Vars.html#Global-Reg-Vars">Global Register Variables&lt;/a>', which allows you to assign a global variable to always reside in a specific hardware register. GCC implements this feature basically by removing the register specified from the list of known registers that its register allocator uses.&lt;br />&lt;br />So the solution for LLVM is a new calling convention but how does this work? Well the calling convention passes arguments in the hardware registers that GHC expects to find the STG machine registers in. So on entry to any function they're in the correct place. Unlike with the NCG or C backend this doesn't exclusively reserve the registers, so in the middle of a function we can't guarantee that the STG machine registers will still be in the hardware registers, they may have been spilled to the stack. This is fine, in fact its an improvement. It allows LLVM to generate the most efficient register allocation, having more registers and flexibility than the other backends, while still maintaining compatibility with them since on any function entry the STG machine registers are guaranteed to be in the correct hardware registers.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Evaluation of the backend&lt;/h2>The two benchmarks at the start gave you a taste of the performance improvements that LLVM is able to bring to GHC. However, how does it perform across the board? The best way I have to test this at the moment is by using a benchmark suite included with GHC called 'nofib'. Currently this suite puts the native code generators in first place, with the LLVM code generator a close second at 3% behind in run time and the C code generator in last place at 6% behind. An important characteristic of the LLVM code generator though is that its consistent. At its best its able to beat the existing backends with a 2x speed-up in run time while at its worst its usually within 3 - 30% of the performance of the best of the NCG or C backend. So you don't get any cases like the NCG has where it really looses out. Its also worth noting that no work has been done yet on optimising the performance of the LLVM backend.&lt;br />&lt;br />The other great benefit of the LLVM code generator is its smaller size and simpler code base. The NCG clocks in at ~20,500 lines of code, the C backend at ~5,300 and the LLVM backend at ~3,100. For the C backend, around 2,000 lines of that code are Perl code which does the post processing of the GCC produced assembly, fragile and complex code full of regular expressions. For the LLVM backend around 1,200 lines of its code are a library for generating and printing out LLVM Assembly, so the complex code generation code is only at around 1,800 lines.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Problems with backend&lt;/h2>There is one major issue remaining with the LLVM backend that I currently know of, its inability to implement a optimisation used by GHC called &lt;em>'TABLES_NEXT_TO_CODE'&lt;/em> (TNTC).&lt;br />&lt;br />For functions, GHC needs to associate some meta-data with them, referred to as an info table. This table contains information about the function used by the run time system. Without the TNTC optimisation the linking of a table and function is done by having the info table contain a pointer to the function. With the TNTC optimisation the code and data is laid out so that the info table resides immediately before the function. This allows both the function and its info table to be accessed from the same pointer, which speeds up access of a function (one pointer lookup instead of two) and reduces the size of info tables.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Br4acuar1QM/S-OwSLPvitI/AAAAAAAAAPo/BSjScxNzjY8/s1600/heap_layout.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}">&lt;img alt="GHC Code Layout Modes" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468408198860868306" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Br4acuar1QM/S-OwSLPvitI/AAAAAAAAAPo/BSjScxNzjY8/s400/heap_layout.png" style="cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 191px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px;" />&lt;/a>&lt;br />How the other two backends handle this is the similar to the STG machine registers. The NCG can implement this with no problems, while the C backend is unable to do this in plain C. However, this time with no GCC extensions able to implement the optimisation either it resorts to post processing the assembly code produced by GCC. For LLVM we have the same problem as the C backend, LLVM doesn't provide a way to explicitly layout the code and data in the object file like we need. This optimisation is fairly significant, giving about a 5% reduction in run times when enabled, so its something I hope to fix up in the future either by adding support for it to LLVM or by post processing the assembly as the C backend does.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Success of LLVM?&lt;/h2>When I asked for the GHC calling convention to be included in LLVM a price was asked of me, a blog post, this one. So I asked Chris what he felt I should write about. There is just one point left to cover to make sure I've paid in full.&lt;br />&lt;pre>&amp;gt; [Chris Lattner]: Talking about what you think is good and what you think should be improved in LLVM would also be great. :)&lt;/pre>&lt;br />I'd like to see LLVM gain the needed features to be able to implement the TNTC optimisation in the GHC backend. It would also be great if LLVM was better supported on Sparc as that's a platform GHC works reasonably well on where LLVM doesn't. As for what is good? When you look at the GHC LLVM backend, it achieves very close or better performance than existing backends that have been around for years, while having a smaller and simpler code base. I think you also gain a lot from the LLVM type system, it really helped catch most of the bugs fixed so far in the backend. Finally the great documentation. This is something I really appreciate and often is lacking in many projects. &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Future&lt;/h2>Since finishing my thesis at the end of 2009, I haven't been able to get much work done on the LLVM backend. However I was lucky enough to receive an internship with Microsoft Research in Cambridge, UK, where two of the primary GHC developers (Simon Marlow &amp;amp; Simon Peyton Jones) work. As part of this I'll be looking to implement the TNTC optimisation as well as general stabilisation and optimisation work. The backend only takes advantage of features offered in 2.5, so I also need to investigate and update it to use the newer 2.6 and 2.7 features. There is also a Google Summer of Code student, &lt;a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/student_project/show/google/gsoc2010/haskell/t127230760615">Alp Mestanogullari&lt;/a>, who is working on the backend. He is looking to improve the binding used by the backend to interface with LLVM. This binding currently works by producing LLVM assembly code in a temporary file. We want to change this to use the LLVM API instead as this should bring faster compile speeds and allow us to extend the API offered by GHC to include LLVM features. Should all this work go well, hopefully you'll see LLVM become the default backend for GHC in the next major release :)&lt;br />&lt;br />If you feel like looking into any of this in more detail, you can find my thesis paper on the backend &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cse.unsw.edu.au%2F~pls%2Fthesis%2Fdavidt-thesis.pdf">here&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />- David</description></item><item><title>New "libc++" C++ Standard Library</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/05/new-libc-c-standard-library.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2010 13:32:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/05/new-libc-c-standard-library.html</guid><description>
I'm happy to announce a new subproject of LLVM: "libc++". libc++ is an implementation of the C++ Standard Library, with a focus on standards compliance, highly efficient generated code, and with an aim to support C++'0x when the standard is ratified. libc++ is written and maintained by Howard Hinnant, but we look forward to contributions from the LLVM community.&lt;br />&lt;br />libc++ is approximately 85% complete at this point (including C++'0x features), and while it is intended to support and complement the Clang++ compiler, it can be ported to work with a broad variety of different C++ compilers.

A common request by front-end authors is to be able to add some sort of metadata to LLVM IR. This metadata could be used to influence language-specific optimization passes (for example, Type Based Alias Analysis in C), tag information for a custom code generator, or pass through information to link time optimization. LLVM 2.7 provides first-class support for this, and has switched debug information over to use it (improving debug info!). &lt;br />&lt;br />While the details of this feature can be found in the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM Language Reference&lt;/a> manual, sometimes it is hard to distill the big picture from the low-level details. This post tries to fill the gap by explaining some history, motivation and example use cases for this new LLVM 2.7 feature.&lt;br />&lt;br />This post was written by Devang Patel and myself.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;br />Before we dive into how metadata works, it is useful to describe how debug information was represented in LLVM 2.6 and earlier:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Debug Information in LLVM 2.6&lt;/h2>&lt;br />Debugging information communicates source location information, type information and variable information to the debugger. This information is not used during the execution of program and does not result in executable code in the object file, but the code generator uses it to produce DWARF information. In this way, debug information is a sort of side channel from the front-end to the DWARF emitter in the code generator.&lt;br />&lt;br />For lack of a better mechanism, in LLVM 2.6 and earlier, debugging information is encoded using global variables tagged with a special "llvm.metadata" section. For example, we would generate something like this to describe C code like "int my_data;":&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>@my_data = common global i32 0, align 4&lt;br />&lt;br />@llvm.dbg.global_variable = internal constant %llvm.dbg.global_variable.type { &lt;br /> i32 458804, &lt;br /> {}* bitcast (%llvm.dbg.anchor.type* @llvm.dbg.global_variables to { }*), &lt;br /> {}* bitcast (%llvm.dbg.compile_unit.type* @llvm.dbg.compile_unit to { }*), &lt;br /> i8* getelementptr ([8 x i8]* @.str4, i32 0, i32 0), &lt;br /> i8* getelementptr ([8 x i8]* @.str4, i32 0, i32 0), &lt;br /> i8* null, &lt;br /> {}* bitcast (%llvm.dbg.compile_unit.type* @llvm.dbg.compile_unit to { }*), &lt;br /> i32 2, &lt;br /> {}* bitcast (%llvm.dbg.basictype.type* @llvm.dbg.basictype to { }*), &lt;br /> i1 false, &lt;br /> i1 true, &lt;br /> {}* bitcast (i32* @my_data to {}*)&lt;br />}, section "llvm.metadata"&lt;br />&lt;br />@.str4 = internal constant [8 x i8] c"my_data\00", section "llvm.metadata"&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />In this example, @my_data is the actual global variable generated for the C variable. This is what gets generated regardless of whether debug info is enabled or not.&lt;br />&lt;br />Here, @.str4 and @llvm.dbg.global_variable were interpreted by the code generator as descriptors holding information about @my_data, with various fields indicating the line number the global is declared, the compile unit, etc. You can see a full description of these fields in the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/releases/2.6/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.html#format_global_variables">LLVM2.6 Debug Info docs&lt;/a>. At code generation time, the dwarf writer would walk this and convert it to DWARF information. The LLVM globals would not get emitted as normal code because they are in the magic llvm.metadata section.&lt;br />&lt;br />While this did provide a basic level of functionality, it had a number of drawbacks. First, the @my_data global variable has an extra use in the IR, which may influence optimization of @my_data. For example the dead global elimination pass wouldn't delete it if dead, and the mod/ref analysis pass wouldn't analyze it because it appears that its address is taken. One major goal of debug information is that turning it on should not affect the executable code generated by the compiler. If it did, turning on debug info could hide the bug you're trying to track down!&lt;br />&lt;br />A second drawback of this implementation is that it has lots of pointless bitcast constant expressions. These extra objects bloat memory footprint, take time to allocate, unique and optimize, etc. The bitcasts also negatively impact readability of LLVM intermediate code, and are completely unnecessary: the dwarf emitter doesn't care about the types, it is walking this information as a data structure, not emitting it to memory.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Motivation for LLVM IR Metadata&lt;/h2>&lt;br />Based on our experiences with debug info, and a desire to implement new cool things, we &lt;a href="http://nondot.org/~sabre/LLVMNotes/EmbeddedMetadata.txt">designed&lt;/a> and implemented a brave new world where metadata was actually a first-class part of LLVM IR. The design aims to solve the issues mentioned above:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>Optimizations shouldn't be affected by metadata unless they explicitly try to look at it.&lt;/li>&lt;li>We want to reduce the memory footprint and cost of debug info.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Metadata shouldn't have LLVM IR types.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Ideally, the syntactic clutter should be reduced, improving the odds that someone can decode this stuff.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;br />Another important design point is that we want to be able to add new forms of metadata without the optimizers having to be updated to support them. This is a critical design point, because we want the metadata to be &lt;em>extensible&lt;/em> by front-end authors to do whatever they want, and shouldn't require hacking the optimizers.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Metadata in LLVM 2.7&lt;/h2>&lt;br />Metadata support includes several different related IR extensions: a new '&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#t_metadata">metadata&lt;/a>' type in LLVM IR, new &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#metadata">MDString&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#metadata">MDNode&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#namedmetadatastructure">NamedMDNode&lt;/a> classes (all three of which derive from 'Value'), added support for referencing metadata from &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#intrinsics">intrinsics&lt;/a>, and support for &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#metadata">attaching it to instructions&lt;/a>. Metadata support is generally in the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/Metadata_8h-source.html">llvm/Metadata.h&lt;/a> header. We'll walk through each of these constructs in turn:&lt;br />&lt;br />The new &lt;b>'metadata' type&lt;/b> is the LLVM Type of each new IR object. This ensures that you can't use metadata as operands to random instructions, for example, you can't do '&lt;tt>add i32 4, !"str"&lt;/tt>' since metadata is not a first-class type. The restrictions on metadata mean that it can only appear as an argument to an intrinsic, as an operand to another metadata, at top-level in a module (NamedMDNode), or be attached to an instruction.&lt;br />&lt;br />The new &lt;b>MDString class&lt;/b> is used to represent string data in metadata, and it always has a metadata type. Since MDStrings are meant as metadata, not code, they are not null terminated in the .ll file. The MDString class allows C++ code walking the IR to access the arbitrary string data with a StringRef. In the .ll file, its syntax is something like:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>!"foo"&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />The new &lt;b>MDNode class&lt;/b> is a tuple that can reference arbitrary LLVM IR values in the program as well as other metadata. In the .ll file, MDNodes are numbered and the syntax for referring to one is "!123" where 123 is the number of the node being referenced. An MDNode is declared with something like:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>!23 = !{ i32 4, !"foo", i32 *@G, metadata !22 }&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />In this case, the MDNode has four operands, the first is a ConstantInt, the second is a MDString, the third is a global variable, the fourth is another MDNode. MDNode's come in two flavors: one is a normal global MDNode which references global variables, constants etc. The second is a function-local MDNode, which can (potentially transitively) refer to instructions within a particular function. One important aspect of MDNodes is that they are not considered to be "uses" of a value: for example, they won't be found with use_iterator and aren't counted for predicates like Value::hasOneUse(). This prevents metadata from accidentally affecting code generation.&lt;br />&lt;br />The new &lt;b>NamedMDNode class&lt;/b> provides named access to metadata at a module level, and each NamedMDNode contains a list of MDNode's. This gives clients of metadata (e.g. debug info) the ability to find all the metadata of a particular form (e.g. global variable debug descriptors). The Module class maintains a list of NamedMDNode instances just like it does global variables, functions, and aliases. In the .ll file, a NamedMDNode looks like this:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>!my_named_mdnode = !{ !1, !2, !4212 }&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />This defines a NamedMDNode with three referenced MDNodes.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>LLVM intrinsics may reference metadata&lt;/b> as normal operands. More specifically, they can directly reference MDNode and MDString objects even though other calls and other operations cannot. In .ll files, this looks something like:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>!0 = metadata !{i32 524544, ...&lt;br />&lt;br />...&lt;br /> %x = alloca i32&lt;br /> call void @llvm.dbg.declare(metadata !{i32* %x}, metadata !0)&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />This passes the module-level !0 MDNode into the second argument and passes a function-local MDNode as the first argument (which, since it is an mdnode, does not count as a use of %X). In this case, the code generator uses this information to know that the metadata !0 is the variable descriptor for the alloca %X. Note that intrinsics themselves are not considered metadata, so they can affect code generation etc.&lt;br />&lt;br />Finally, &lt;b>metadata can be attached to instructions&lt;/b>. Instructions can have an arbitrary list of MDNodes attached to them with string tags. For example:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>store i32 0, i32* %P, !nontemporal !2, !frobnatz !123&lt;br /> ret void, !dbg !9&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />The first case is a store with two instruction-level metadata records attached to it, one named 'nontemporal' (which is &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#i_store">implemented in LLVM 2.7&lt;/a>) and one named 'frobnatz' (which is a great new feature that might be in LLVM 2.8). The second is a return instruction with a debug location attached to it.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Using Extensible Metadata for Debug Info&lt;/h2>&lt;br />To contrast with the LLVM 2.6 debug info example above, in LLVM 2.7 we get something like this:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>@my_data = common global i32 0, align 4&lt;br /> !llvm.dbg.gv = !{!0}&lt;br />&lt;br /> !0 = metadata !{&lt;br /> i32 524340, i32 0, metadata !1, metadata !"my_data", metadata !"my_data",&lt;br /> metadata !"", metadata !1, i32 2, metadata !3,&lt;br /> i1 false, i1 true, i32* @my_data&lt;br /> }&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />This replaces the global variables with an MDNode and MDString. This shrinks the IR by eliminating the pointless bitcasts, eliminating the irrelevant IR types, and the use of @my_data by !0 is no longer considered a "use". However, we still have lots of &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.html#format_global_variables">magic fields that are documented elsewhere&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />If you'd like to see more examples of debug info, you can see what the frontend generates by using something like "&lt;tt>clang foo.c -g -S -o - -emit-llvm | less&lt;/tt>".&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>What to use Metadata for&lt;/h2>&lt;br />A subtle point that was touched on above is that we don't want the optimizers to have to know about metadata. While it is very feasible to make optimizations preserve specific metadata (e.g. loop strength reduction could do some sort of fancy thing to update debug info it if wanted) by default, optimizations ignore and destroy it. For example, if an optimization deletes an instruction and there is a function-level MDNode referencing it, the reference in the MDNode will implicitly drop to null.&lt;br />&lt;br />This has some important implications on what it is safe to use metadata for: it can only be used for "value add" information, information that does not change the semantics of the program. To repeat this important point, &lt;b>use of metadata is only safe if the program retains its semantics when the metadata is silently dropped&lt;/b>.&lt;br />&lt;br />For example, it is trivially safe for debug information to use metadata (though the dwarf emitter has to be careful to tolerate null pointers!): if metadata is dropped, it just means that debug information &lt;em>quality&lt;/em> is reduced, it doesn't invalidate the debug info itself. In our example above, if the global "my_data" is deleted by the optimizer, the reference will drop to null and the debug info emitter won't generate a location for my_data.&lt;br />&lt;br />While this may sound limiting, there are lots of potential uses cases for metadata, you just have to be careful how you structure it. Lets run through a few examples:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Current and Potential Clients of Metadata&lt;/h2>&lt;br />LLVM 2.7 supports generating &lt;b>non-temporal &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#i_load">loads&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#i_store">stores&lt;/a>&lt;/b> using the !nontemporal instruction-level modifier as documented in the LangRef manual. A non-temporal access is normal access with a hint to the CPU that it can avoid pulling data into the cache, as it won't be accessed again recently. This is safe because !nontemporal is an optimization hint: dropping the !nontemporal hint will result in the optimizer producing a normal load and store, which may have lower performance, but provides the same semantics as an actual non-temporal access.&lt;br />&lt;br />A potential future use case is to support &lt;b>Type-Based Alias Analysis&lt;/b> (TBAA). TBAA is an optimization to know that "float *P1" and "int *P2" can never alias (in GCC, this is enabled with -fstrict-aliasing). The trick with this is that it isn't safe to implement TBAA in terms of LLVM IR types, you really need to be able to encode and express a type-subset graph according to the complex source-level rules (e.g. in C, "char*" can alias anything).&lt;br />&lt;br />An LLVM implementation of TBAA would encode the type-subset graph with MDNodes, and add type tags to load and store operations with a !tbaa instruction tag. A new &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/AliasAnalysis.html">AliasAnalysis&lt;/a> implementation would look for these tags on accesses and walk the type subset graph to determine if the two accesses might alias each other. This use of metadata is also safe, because it is an optimization: if the type tag gets dropped, it is always safe to assume that the access aliases everything for TBAA purposes.&lt;br />&lt;br />More broadly, metadata is a great way for a &lt;b>front-end to communicate arbitrary information to custom language-specific optimization passes&lt;/b>. TBAA is one example, but this could equally apply to things like devirtualization (through class hierarchy analysis), doing locking and exception handling optimizations, even library-centric optimizations could be implemented with this.&lt;br />&lt;br />Since LLVM 2.7 is only the first release that supports metadata in its IR, we have yet to see how it will ultimately get used. If you end up using it in a novel or interesting way, please send me a link describing your use and I'll link to it from this post.&lt;br />&lt;br />-Chris and Devang</description></item><item><title>Intro to the LLVM MC Project</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/intro-to-llvm-mc-project.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Apr 2010 23:27:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/intro-to-llvm-mc-project.html</guid><description>
The LLVM Machine Code (aka MC) sub-project of LLVM was created to solve a number of problems in the realm of assembly, disassembly, object file format handling, and a number of other related areas that CPU instruction-set level tools work in. It is a sub-project of &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM&lt;/a> which provides it with a number of advantages over other compilers that do not have tightly integrated assembly-level tools.&lt;br />&lt;br />This blog post talks about how the MC project evolved, describes a few different aspects of it , talks about the improvements/capabilities it brings to LLVM, and finishes off with the current status of the project.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>History and Background&lt;/h2>&lt;br />Before MC came around, LLVM was already a mature compiler system that support both static compilation (through a normal assembler) and as well as JIT compilation (which emitted encoded instruction bytes directly to memory) on many different targets and sub-targets. However, despite these capabilities, the implementation of these subsystems was not designed wonderfully: why should the X86 instruction encoder (used by the JIT) have to know how to encode the weird pseudo instructions that the X86 code generator uses for its convenience? Why was this code emitter specific to the one code model used by the JIT?&lt;br />&lt;br />Beyond lack of elegance, it has been a goal for quite a while (for example, see &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/devmtg/2009-10/">Bruno's 2009 devmtg talk&lt;/a>) to directly integrate an assembler into the compiler. Doing so would solve a number of problems: For fast compiles, it is incredibly wasteful for the compiler to carefully format a massive text file, then fork/exec an assembler, which then has to lex/parse/validate the file. In fact, since the rest of Clang is so fast, &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/performance.html">the assembler takes ~20% of compile time&lt;/a> for C code at -O0 -g. In addition to winning back this performance, not relying on an external assembler is attractive for several other reasons: the compiler doesn't have to worry about lots of different buggy assemblers which have similar but inconsistent syntax, Windows users typically don't have assemblers (and MASM is not fully-featured enough to be targeted by a compiler), some systems like FreeBSD have old versions of binutils that lack modern features, etc.&lt;br />&lt;br />Previously, we tried implementing a "&lt;a href="http://wiki.llvm.org/Notes:Machine_Code_Emission_in_an_ideal_world">direct object emission&lt;/a>" system to allow the code generator to write .o files without an assembler, but this project hit a number of problems. One of the biggest problems is that it tried to re-implement all of the logic in AsmPrinter which handled "lowering" of the codegen IR to machine level constructs. This includes the logic that handled selection of linkage types, section selection, constant lowering and emission, lowering of debug info and exception info, etc. While these may not sound like a big deal, this logic is very delicate and having subtle differences between the .o file writer and .s file writer (e.g. one emitted a strong symbol and one emitting a weak symbol) wasn't acceptable. This previous project never even got to the interesting parts of an assembler, like relaxation support.&lt;br />&lt;br />Finally, beyond the previous scope of LLVM, there is a bigger toolchain out there that has to deal with things like assembly and disassembly of instructions. When a new instruction set extension comes around (e.g. SSE 4.2) the new instructions need to be added to the assembler, the disassembler, and the compiler. Since LLVM already had a JIT, it already knew how to do encoding of instructions, and we speculated that it might be reasonable to produce an assembler from the textual descriptions of the instructions in the code generator's tables. It would be great to be able to add an instruction description to one place and get the assembler, disassembler, and compiler backend support all at once.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Primary MC Components&lt;/h2>&lt;br />You can break down the MC-related data structures and components into "that which operates on instructions" and "that which does other stuff". To provide a consistent abstraction we introduced the new &lt;b>&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1MCInst.html">MCInst&lt;/a>&lt;/b> class to represent an instruction with operands (e.g. registers, immediates, etc) which is separate from the code generator's existing notion of an instruction (MachineInstr). The "other stuff" includes a variety of classes like &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1MCSymbol.html">MCSymbol&lt;/a> (which represents a label in a .s file), &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1MCSection.html">MCSection&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1MCExpr.html">MCExpr&lt;/a> etc. You can read the headers in the llvm/include/MC directory for more information on these.&lt;br />&lt;br />These MC classes live at a very low level in the LLVM system, depending only on the support and system libraries. The idea of this is that you can build something low-level (like a disassembler library) that doesn't have to link in the entire LLVM code generator (a disassembler doesn't need a register allocator :).&lt;br />&lt;br />Given this background, I'll talk about the major components of the MC project: the instruction printer, the instruction encoder, the instruction parser, the instruction decoder, the assembly parser, the assembler backend, and the compiler integration. LLVM already had these (except the instruction decoder and assembly parser), but the existing code has been refactored out and reworked substantially.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Instruction Printer&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />The instruction printer is a very simple target-specific component that implements the MCInstPrinter API. Given a single MCInst, it formats and emits the textual representation of the instruction to a raw_ostream. Targets can have multiple MCInstPrinters, for example the X86 backend includes an AT&amp;amp;T and an Intel Syntax instruction printer. MCInstPrinters don't know anything about sections, directives, or other things like that so they are independent of object file format.&lt;br />&lt;br />Instruction printing is somewhat fiddly code (formatting all the operands exactly right, dealing with inconsistencies in the syntax of various instructions, etc) but LLVM already had a &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/TableGenFundamentals.html">TableGen&lt;/a> backend that auto-generated much of this from the .td files. Getting an old-style LLVM target to support this requires introducing a new MachineInstr -&amp;gt; MCInst lowering pass, which then passes the MCInst to the InstPrinter.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />Instruction Encoder&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />The instruction encoder is another target-specific component which transforms an MCInst into a series of bytes and a list of relocations, implementing the MCCodeEmitter API. The API is quite general, allowing any bytes generated to be written to a raw_ostream. Because the X86 instruction encoding is very complex (aka "completely insane"), the X86 backend implements this interface with custom C++ code that is driven from data encoded in the .td files. This is the only realistic way to handle all the prefix bytes, REX bytes etc, and is derived from the old JIT encoder for X86. We hope and expect that encoders for future RISC targets will be directly generated from the .td files. When used by the compiler, the same MachineInst -&amp;gt; MCInst lowering code is used as for the instruction printer.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />Instruction Parser&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />In order to parse instructions when reading a .s file, targets can implement lexers and parsers for their syntax, providing the TargetAsmParser API. The lexer is largely shared code that is parameterized based on common assembly syntax features (e.g. what is the comment character?), but the parser is all target-specific. Once an instruction opcode and its operands have been parsed, it goes through a 'matching' process which decides which concrete instruction is being specified. For example, on X86, "addl $4, %eax" is an instruction with a 1-byte immediate, but "addl $256, %eax" uses a 4-byte immediate field and is represented as a different MCInst.&lt;br />&lt;br />The output of an parsed instruction is an opcode + list of operands, and the parser also exposes the API for matching. Not all instructions can be matched as they are parsed from a .s file (for example, an immediate size might depend on the distance between two labels) so instructions can be held in a more abstract-than-MCInst representation until relaxation is performed if required.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />Instruction Decoder&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />As you might expect, the instruction decoder implements the MCDisassembler API and turns an abstract series of bytes (implemented with the MemoryObject API, to handle remote disassembly) into an MCInst and a size. As with previous components, a target may implement multiple different decoders (the X86 backend implements X86-16, X86-32, and X86-64 decoders). The decoder turns immediate fields into simple integer immediate operands, if there is a reference to a symbol, the relocation representing the symbol has to be handled by a client of the decoder.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />Assembly Parser&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />The assembly parser handles all the directives and other gunk that is in an .s file that is not an instruction (which may be generic or may be object-file specific). This is the thing that knows what .word, .globl etc are, and it uses the instruction parser to handle instructions. The input to the Assembly parser is a MemoryBuffer object (which contains the input file) and the assembly parser invokes actions of an MCStreamer interface for each thing it does.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>MCStreamer is a very important API&lt;/b>: it is essentially an "assembler API" with one virtual method per directive and one "EmitInstruction" method that takes an MCInst. The MCStreamer API is implemented by the MCAsmStreamer assembly printer (which implements support for printing these directives to a .s file and uses the Instruction Printer to format the MCInsts) as well as the assembler backend (which writes out a .o file). It is impossible to overstate how important the MCStreamer API is for the overall MC picture to fit together as we'll see later. &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />Assembler Backend&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />The assembler backend is one implementation of the MCStreamer API (along with the "MCAsmStreamer" text assembly code emitter) which implements all the "hard stuff" that assemblers do. For example, the assembler has to do "relaxation" which is the process that handles things like branch shortening, situations like "the size of this instruction depends on how far apart these two labels are, but the instruction is between the two labels, how do we break the cycle?" etc. It lays out fragments into sections, resolves instructions with symbolic operands down to immediates and passes this information off to object-file specific code that writes out (say) an ELF or MachO .o file.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />Compiler Integration&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />The final major piece of the puzzle is integrating this all into the compiler. In practice this meant making the compiler talk directly to the MCStreamer API to emit directives and instructions instead of emitting a text file. Converting over all the targets, debug info, eh emission, etc was a major project, and doubly so because it was taken as an opportunity to fix a bunch of major design issues in the AsmPrinter implementations (lots of copy and paste code etc). The new system is much better factored and lowers directly to MC constructs like MCSection and MCSymbol instead of passing around strings and using other ad-hoc data structures.&lt;br />&lt;br />The end result of this work is that the compiler backend now invokes the same MCStreamer interface to emit code that the stand-alone assembler parser does. This gives us high confidence that using the compiler backend to emit a text file (with the "MCAsmStreamer") and reading it back in with the asmparser will result in the same MCStreamer calls as when the code generator directly invokes them. &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Building on these Primitive Components&lt;/h2>&lt;br />Now that you know about the major components of the MC ecosystem, and you've seen how key data structures like MCInst and MCStreamer are used to communicate between the components, we can talk about building nice things out of them.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />Disassembler Library&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />One major high-level API built on this is the "enhanced disassembler" API, which uses these components in this sequence:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>It uses the Instruction Decoder to read machine code bytes in memory into an MCInst and determine instruction sizes.&lt;/li>&lt;li>It uses the Instruction Printer to print the textual form of the instruction to a buffer.&lt;/li>&lt;li>It uses the Instruction Parser to re-parse the textual form to find precise operand boundaries in the text and build a symbolic form of the operand.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;br />This library provides a number of great capabilities. Sean described it and the X86 implementation in &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2010/01/x86-disassembler.html">his previous blog post&lt;/a>, and the interface is in the &lt;tt>llvm/include/llvm-c/EnhancedDisassembly.h&lt;/tt> header.&lt;br />&lt;br />You can also access some of the functionality on the command line by using the llvm-mc tool:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>echo "0xCD 0x21" | llvm-mc --disassemble -triple=x86_64-apple-darwin9&lt;/b>&lt;br /> int $33&lt;br />$ &lt;b>echo "0 0" | llvm-mc --disassemble -triple=x86_64-apple-darwin9&lt;/b>&lt;br /> addb %al, (%rax)&lt;br />$ &lt;b>echo "0 0" | llvm-mc --disassemble -triple=i386-apple-darwin9&lt;/b>&lt;br /> addb %al, (%eax)&lt;br />$ &lt;b>echo "0x0f 0x01 0xc2" | llvm-mc --disassemble -triple=i386-apple-darwin9&lt;/b>&lt;br /> vmlaunch&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />Stand-alone Assembler&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />If you combine the Assembly Parser, Instruction Parser, the Assembler Backend and the Instruction Encoder, you get a traditional stand-alone system assembler. The llvm-mc tool provides this capability with a command like:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>llvm-mc foo.s -filetype=obj -o foo.o&lt;/b>&lt;br />$ &lt;b>echo " invalid_inst _foo, %ebx" | llvm-mc -filetype=obj -o /dev/null&lt;/b>&lt;br />&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;:1:5: error: unrecognized instruction&lt;br /> invalid_inst _foo, %ebx&lt;br /> ^&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />The second example shows that the assembly parser gives nice caret diagnostics, not just "parse error on line 1" that many assemblers produce.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />Really Complicated Assembly 'cat'&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />If you want to, you can take the stand-alone assembler and hook the MCAsmStreamer interface up to the MCStreamer the assembler is calling. This allows you to read in a .s file (validating it) and then immediately print it back out. You can also play with options like -show-encoding and -show-inst (which shows MCInsts). Assembly cat is the default mode of llvm-mc for testing's sake, and you can play with it like this:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>llvm-mc foo.s -o bar.s&lt;/b>&lt;br />$ &lt;b>echo "addl %eax, %ebx" | llvm-mc -show-encoding -show-inst&lt;/b>&lt;br /> .section __TEXT,__text,regular,pure_instructions&lt;br /> addl %eax, %ebx ## encoding: [0x01,0xc3]&lt;br /> ## &amp;lt;MCInst #66 ADD32rr&lt;br /> ## &amp;lt;MCOperand Reg:29&amp;gt;&lt;br /> ## &amp;lt;MCOperand Reg:29&amp;gt;&lt;br /> ## &amp;lt;MCOperand Reg:27&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br />$ &lt;b>echo "xorl _foo, %ebx" | llvm-mc -show-encoding&lt;/b>&lt;br /> .section __TEXT,__text,regular,pure_instructions&lt;br /> xorl _foo, %ebx ## encoding: [0x33,0x1c,0x25,A,A,A,A]&lt;br /> ## fixup A - offset: 3, value: _foo, kind: FK_Data_4&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />The last example shows that the instruction encoder generates a fixup (aka relocation) as well as the data bytes for the instruction.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />Assembly Generating Compiler&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />Now that the compiler is wired up to emit all of its code through the MCStreamer API, we can connect various streamers to it. To get a "classic compiler", we can hook up an MCAsmStreamer to the and get a normal .s file out of the compiler:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>clang foo.c -S -o foo.s&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />This uses the MCAsmStreamer and the Instruction Printers for the current target. One interesting observation is that .s file printing is very performance critical in the old world (when you don't have direct .o file writing support). Generating that huge text file requires a lot of detailed formatting and the compiler isn't doing a lot else at "-O0" mode, so it is a significant percentage of compile time.&lt;br />&lt;br />However, most build systems (e.g. makefiles) use the compiler in "-c" mode which asks for a .o file. If the compiler supports directly writing a .o file, the .s path isn't hot at all because it isn't being used. This means that we can reasonably make -S mode default to emitting a .s file with tons of helpful comments in it: this mode (e.g. gcc -fverbose-asm) is supported in some form by many compilers, but most people don't know it exists. The presence of direct .o file writing support means that we can turn this on by default! Also, the LLVM implementation of this is pretty nice, with information about spills, loop nests etc.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>&lt;br />Compiler-Integrated Assembler&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />As you might have guessed by now, LLVM also supports an integrated assembler. While this will eventually become the default for targets that support it, right now clang requires you to pass the -integrated-as flag:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>clang foo.c -c -o foo.o -integrated-as&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />To the user, this works just like the non-integrated-as support. If you pass -v though, you'll see that the compiler is directly emitting the .o file and the assembler isn't run by the driver.&lt;br />&lt;br />This works very simply: the assembler backend is provided as the MCStreamer to the compiler, and it handles the various things the system assembler used to take care of. This means that the assembler never has to (for example) print out MCInsts to a textual representation and reparse them, it just passes the well-formed MCInsts the code generator is using directly to the assembler backend.&lt;br />&lt;br />This is all well and good except for one thing: inline assembly. With inline assembly, arbitrary assembly language can be included in the source file (optionally munged by the compiler to insert operand constraint information etc), and we have no choice but to parse this with the assembly parser. Fortunately, we have a nice clean and well decomposed system, so we the assembly handling code just creates a new temporary assembly parser to handle the inline asm, and has it talk to the same MCStreamer instance that the compiler is using. This means that the current state of the streamer is the same when the inline assembly is parsed as it would be if the system assembler is used.&lt;br />&lt;br />Using an integrated has other benefits as well: we can tightly integrate it with the clang diagnostics system instead of having the assembler detect the error late and report it with a foreign error. Beyond consistency, we can actually give really good information about where the error occurs, relaying it back to where in the &lt;em>original source code&lt;/em> the problem is. Compare these examples with and without the integrated assembler:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>cat t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />int foo(int X) {&lt;br /> __asm__ ("frob %0" : "+r" (X));&lt;br /> return X;&lt;br />}&lt;br />$ &lt;b>gcc t.c&lt;/b> &lt;br />/var/folders/51/51Qw875vFdGa9KojoIi7Zk+++TM/-Tmp-//ccyXfgfZ.s:11:no such instruction: `frob %eax'&lt;br />$ &lt;b>clang t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />/var/folders/51/51Qw875vFdGa9KojoIi7Zk+++TM/-Tmp-/cc-4zimMn.s:15:no such instruction: `frob %eax'&lt;br />clang: error: assembler command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)&lt;br />$ &lt;b>clang t.c -integrated-as&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;b>t.c:2:11: &lt;font color="red">error:&lt;/font> unrecognized instruction&lt;/b>&lt;br /> frob %eax&lt;br />&lt;font color="green"> ^&lt;/font>&lt;br />&lt;b>&amp;lt;inline asm&amp;gt;:1:2: note:&lt;/b> instantated into assembly here&lt;br /> __asm__ ("frob %0" : "+r" (X));&lt;br />&lt;font color="green"> ^&lt;/font>&lt;br />1 error generated.&lt;br />&lt;/inline>&lt;/pre>&lt;br />I don't know about you, but I find it much more useful to know that line 2 of my C file is the problem than to find out that line 15 of a deleted file is. :) It is worth pointing out that it is incredibly important to show the code being parsed by the assembler, because after operand substitution etc it is not always clear from the source code what the problem is.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Status and Open Projects!&lt;/h2>&lt;br />As described above, the architecture of the MC subsystems is already quite advanced and we have a lot of code written. However, not all of it is production quality and we don't yet have people signed up to do all the interesting work! As of this writing here is the high level status:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>All the clang-side work is done: the driver knows -integrated-as, the diagnostics subsystem can handle assembler errors, the code generator is fully switched over to use MCStreamer, etc.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The X86 and ARM &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2010/01/x86-disassembler.html">disassemblers&lt;/a> are in good shape and considered to be at or near production quality.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The X86 instruction printer is done for both AT&amp;amp;T and Intel Syntax.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The MC components have been designed to be object file independent (e.g. work for MachO, ELF, PE-COFF etc) but only have an implementation for MachO (used on Mac OS/X systems). Adding support for ELF and/or PE-COFF should be reasonably straight-forward.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The X86 AT&amp;amp;T-syntax assembly parser is missing some important features, e.g. forward/backward labels, support for inferring suffixes on instructions (e.g. add -&amp;gt; addl), macros etc. However, it is sufficiently advanced to reliably parse everything generated by the LLVM X86 backend. Adding these missing features should be quite straight-forward.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The X86 Intel-syntax assembly parser doesn't exist.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The ARM assembly parser is not complete (probably 50% to useful), and the instruction printer is about 50% refactored from the old-style printer.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The assembler backend works quite well and currently tries to produces bitwise identical object files to the system assembler on the Mac (to allow validating through "/usr/bin/cmp"). That said, it's algorithms aren't all performance tuned, so it could probably be substantially faster.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The old JIT code path is still alive in LLVM, it should be killed off once it is replaced with a new MC implementation. One win of this is that the JIT will support inline assembly :)&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;br />If you're interested in this level of the tool chain, this is a great area to get involved in, because there are lots of small to mid-sized projects just waiting to be tackled. I believe that the long term impact of this work is huge: it allows building new interesting CPU-level tools and it means that we can add new instructions to one .td file instead of having to add them to the compiler, the assembler, the disassembler, etc.&lt;br />&lt;br />-Chris</description></item><item><title>ARM Advanced SIMD (NEON) Intrinsics and Types in LLVM</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/arm-advanced-simd-neon-intrinsics-and.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2010 21:34:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/arm-advanced-simd-neon-intrinsics-and.html</guid><description>
LLVM now supports all the intrinsic functions defined by ARM for the Advanced SIMD (aka "NEON") instruction set, but if you are migrating from GCC to LLVM, there are some implementation differences that you may encounter. LLVM follows ARM's specification of the standard NEON types more closely than GCC. It is also more strict about checking types of arguments to the NEON intrinsics.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />This post describes the NEON-related differences between LLVM and GCC and gives a few examples of how to adapt your code to work with LLVM.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;h2>Background&lt;/h2>&lt;br />NEON is a vector processing extension to the ARM architecture. It is included in most recent ARM processors such as the Cortex A8 and A9. Some of the NEON instructions perform operations that are not simple to specify in C or C++, so ARM has defined a standard set of intrinsic functions for those operations. For example, the vqadd_s16 intrinsic performs a saturating add of two 64-bit vectors with elements that are 16-bit signed integers. ARM has also defined a standard set of NEON vector types to be used with these intrinsics. For example, the arguments and return value of the vqadd_s16 intrinsic have a type of int16x4_t. These intrinsics and types are declared in the &amp;lt;arm_neon.h&amp;gt; header file, which is provided by the compiler.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />There are at least two prior implementations of these NEON intrinsics. ARM's RealView Compilation Tools (RVCT) compiler provides the full set of them, and not surprisingly, RVCT adheres closely to ARM's specification. GCC also has an implementation of NEON intrinsics, but it differs in some ways from RVCT and ARM's specification (at least in the 4.2.1 version from which llvm-gcc is derived).&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />The current status of NEON intrinsics in LLVM is that llvm-gcc has full support for them, although there is undoubtedly room for further performance tuning. Clang does not yet support NEON. Patches are welcome!&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Different Types&lt;/h2>&lt;br />ARM defines the NEON vector types as opaque "containerized vectors". These types are defined in &amp;lt;arm_neon.h&amp;gt; as C structures. The user-visible type names are typedefs to these internal structures. For example, the type for a vector of 4 floats is defined as:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre> typedef struct __simd128_float32_t float32x4_t;&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />The content of the internal structures is not specified, so the only thing you can portably do with values of these types is to pass them to NEON intrinsics.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />GCC has its own syntax for specifying vector types. This syntax is not specific to NEON. A vector type is defined by adding a "__vector_size__" attribute with the total vector size in bytes. For example:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre> typedef float float32x4_t __attribute__ ((__vector_size__ (16)));&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Instead of using the opaque containerized vectors, GCC's implementation of the standard NEON types uses its own vector syntax.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />So what about LLVM? We compromise and do both! The NEON types are defined as structures in &amp;lt;arm_neon.h&amp;gt;, following ARM's specification, but the contents of those structures are vectors defined with GCC's syntax. Each internal structure has a single element named "val" with a GCC vector type. The GCC vector types are defined with a "__neon_" prefix to the standard NEON type name. So, if you want to access the GCC vector type directly, you can do it with LLVM. That code won't be portable &amp;mdash; it won't work with RVCT &amp;mdash; but it may ease the transition from GCC.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />What are the implications of this difference in the NEON types? The main thing is that the LLVM NEON types are aggregates, not scalars, so you can't do things like casting them to integer types. You also can't assign NEON variables to specific NEON registers using "asm" register attributes, since that is not supported for aggregates. See below for some related differences in the way you initialize vectors.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>Stricter Type Checking&lt;/h2>&lt;br />Arguments to LLVM's NEON intrinsics are subject to much stricter type checking than with GCC. GCC's vector types can be cast to other vector types as long as the total size remains the same and you don't mix integer and floating-point vectors. The arguments to GCC's NEON intrinsics get this same treatment. You can pass a uint8x8_t value for a int32x2_t argument and GCC will not even warn you. LLVM requires the argument types to match exactly. If your code is sloppy with vector types, you will have to clean it up to compile with LLVM.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />If you really want to cast NEON vector types, the right way to do it is with the vreinterpret intrinsics. For example, vreinterpret_s32_u8 will perform the cast from uint8x8_t to int32x2_t that was mentioned above.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>How to Initialize a Vector?&lt;/h2>&lt;br />GCC's vector types can be directly assigned a brace-enclosed list of values corresponding to the vector elements. For example:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre> int32x2_t vec = { 1, 2 };&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />initializes a vector with element values 1 and 2. This is convenient but not portable. In general, the best way to assign a vector value is to load it from memory with a NEON intrinsic. That is completely portable and often as fast or faster than the alternatives.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />There are some special cases where you can do better. If all the vector elements have the same value, one of the vdup intrinsics would be a good solution. You can use the vcreate intrinsics to construct vectors from 64-bit values, and the vcombine intrinsics can put two of them together to form a 128-bit vector. However, moving values from general-purpose ARM registers to the NEON register file can be quite slow, so this may not be faster than a load. If the vector elements are floating-point values, then they are likely already in the right register file, and using vset_lane intrinsics to put them together into a vector may be faster. Generating the fastest code for these different cases is a work in progress, so you may need to experiment with different approaches to see which is fastest.</description></item><item><title>What's wrong with this code?</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/whats-wrong-with-this-code.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2010 11:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/whats-wrong-with-this-code.html</guid><description>
A user on IRC sent me this interesting KLEE example today, which I thought was cute enough I should post it.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div>If you aren't familiar with it, &lt;a href="http://klee.llvm.org/">KLEE&lt;/a> is a tool for symbolic execution of LLVM code. It is way too complicated to explain here, but for the purposes of this example all you need to know is that it tries to explore all possible paths through a program.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>In this case, the user was actually talking to me because he thought there was a bug in KLEE, because it was only finding one path through the code. Here is the example:&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;pre>$ cat t.c&lt;br />#include "klee/klee.h"&lt;br />&lt;br />int f0(int x) {&lt;br />if (x * x == 1000)&lt;br />return 1;&lt;br />else&lt;br />return 0;&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />int main() {&lt;br />return f0(klee_int("x"));&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>The idea here is that &lt;tt>klee_int("x")&lt;/tt> creates a new symbolic variable, which can be &lt;i>anything&lt;/i> (well, any possible &lt;tt>int&lt;/tt>).&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>The user was expecting that there would be two possible paths through this program, one returning 1 and one returning 0. But KLEE only finds one:&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;pre>$ clang -I ~/public/klee/include -flto -c t.c&lt;br />$ ~/public/klee.obj.64/Debug/bin/klee t.o&lt;br />KLEE: output directory = "klee-out-5"&lt;br />&lt;br />KLEE: done: total instructions = 24&lt;br />KLEE: done: completed paths = 1&lt;br />KLEE: done: generated tests = 1&lt;/pre>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Upon showing the example to me, I was also confused for a moment. However, since I happen to trust KLEE, I knew to look for a problem in the test case! And of course, the square root of 1000 isn't an integer, so there is no way this code can return 1. If we change the 1000 to 100, KLEE finds two paths as we would expect:&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;pre>$ cat t.c&lt;br />#include "klee/klee.h"&lt;br />&lt;br />int f0(int x) {&lt;br />if (x * x == 100)&lt;br />return 1;&lt;br />else&lt;br />return 0;&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />int main() {&lt;br />return f0(klee_int("x"));&lt;br />}&lt;br />$ clang -I ~/public/klee/include -flto -c t.c&lt;br />$ ~/public/klee.obj.64/Debug/bin/klee t.o&lt;br />KLEE: output directory = "klee-out-6"&lt;br />&lt;br />KLEE: done: total instructions = 31&lt;br />KLEE: done: completed paths = 2&lt;br />KLEE: done: generated tests = 2&lt;/pre>&lt;br />&lt;/div>This example shows exactly what KLEE was designed for -- reasoning about code (or math) is hard, and it is great to let a machine do it for you!</description></item><item><title>Amazing feats of Clang Error Recovery</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/amazing-feats-of-clang-error-recovery.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2010 23:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/amazing-feats-of-clang-error-recovery.html</guid><description>
In addition to parsing and generating machine code for your source files when valid, a compiler frontend's job is also to detect invalid code and give you a hint that explains what is wrong so you can fix the problem. The bug could either be straight-up invalid (an error) or could just be something that is legal but looks really dubious (a warning). These errors and warnings are known as compiler 'diagnostics', and Clang aims to go above and beyond the call of duty to provide a really amazing experience.&lt;br />&lt;br />After the break, we show some examples of areas where Clang tries particularly hard. For other examples, the Clang web page also has &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html">a page on diagnostics&lt;/a> and Doug showed how Clang diagnoses two-phase name lookup issues in &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2009/12/dreaded-two-phase-name-lookup.html">a prior blog post&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Update&lt;/b>: Other people are starting to compare their favorite compiler.

Many compilers have these sorts of issues and we strongly encourage you to try the examples on your favorite compiler to see how it does. The examples all shown are necessarily small (reduced) examples that demonstrate a problem, when you see these in real life, they are often much more convincing :).&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>&lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=6088150582281556517" name="unknown_typenames">Unknown Typenames&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;br />One annoying thing about parsing C and C++ is that you have to know what is a typename in order to parse the code. For example "(x)(y)" can be either a cast of the expression "(y)" to type "x" or it could be a call of the "x" function with the "(y)" argument list, depending on whether x is a type or not. Unfortunately, a common mistake is to forget to include a header file, which means that the compiler really has no idea whether something is a type or not, and therefore has to make a strongly educated guess based on context. Here are a couple examples:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>cat t.m&lt;/b>&lt;br />NSString *P = @"foo";&lt;br />$ &lt;b>clang t.m&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.m:4:1: error: unknown type name 'NSString'&lt;br />NSString *P = @"foo";&lt;br />^&lt;br />$ &lt;b>gcc t.m&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.m:4: error: expected '=', ',', ';', 'asm' or '__attribute__' before '*' token&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />and:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>cat t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />int foo(int x, pid_t y) {&lt;br /> return x+y;&lt;br />}&lt;br />$ &lt;b>clang t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.c:1:16: error: unknown type name 'pid_t'&lt;br />int foo(int x, pid_t y) {&lt;br /> ^&lt;br />$ &lt;b>gcc t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.c:1: error: expected declaration specifiers or '...' before 'pid_t'&lt;br />t.c: In function 'foo':&lt;br />t.c:2: error: 'y' undeclared (first use in this function)&lt;br />t.c:2: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once&lt;br />t.c:2: error: for each function it appears in.)&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />This sort of thing also happens in C if you forget to use 'struct stat' instead of 'stat'. As is a common theme in this post, recovering well by inferring what the programmer meant helps Clang avoid emitting bogus follow-on errors like the three lines GCC emits on line 2. &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>&lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=6088150582281556517" name="spell_checker">Spell Checker&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;br />One of the &lt;a href="http://zi.fi/shots/clang.png">more visible&lt;/a> things that Clang includes is a spell checker (also &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/b8ws6/why_you_should_use_clang/">on reddit&lt;/a>). The spell checker kicks in when you use an identifier that Clang doesn't know: it checks against other close identifiers and suggests what you probably meant. Here are a few examples:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>cat t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;inttypes.h&amp;gt;&lt;br />int64 x;&lt;br />$ &lt;b>clang t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.c:2:1: error: unknown type name 'int64'; did you mean 'int64_t'?&lt;br />int64 x;&lt;br />^~~~~&lt;br />int64_t&lt;br />$ &lt;b>gcc t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.c:2: error: expected '=', ',', ';', 'asm' or '__attribute__' before 'x'&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />another example is:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>cat t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;sys/stat.h&amp;gt;&lt;br />int foo(int x, struct stat *P) { &lt;br /> return P-&amp;gt;st_blocksize*2;&lt;br />}&lt;br />$ &lt;b>clang t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.c:4:13: error: no member named 'st_blocksize' in 'struct stat'; did you mean 'st_blksize'?&lt;br /> return P-&amp;gt;st_blocksize*2;&lt;br /> ^~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /> st_blksize&lt;br />$ &lt;b>gcc t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.c: In function ‘foo’:&lt;br />t.c:4: error: 'struct stat' has no member named 'st_blocksize'&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />The great thing about the spell checker is that it catches a wide variety of common errors, and it also assists in later recovery. Code that later used 'x', for example, knows that it is declared as an int64_t, so it doesn't lead to other weird follow on errors that don't make any sense. Clang uses the well known &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance function&lt;/a> to compute the best match out of the possible candidates.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>&lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=6088150582281556517" name="typedef_tracking">Typedef Tracking&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;br />Clang tracks the typedefs you write in your code carefully so that it can relate errors to the types you use in your code. This allows it to print out error messages in your terms, not in fully resolved and template instantiated compiler terms. It also uses its range information and caret to show you what you wrote instead of trying to print it back out at you. There are several examples of this on the Clang diagnostics page, but one more example can't hurt:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>cat t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />namespace foo {&lt;br /> struct x { int y; };&lt;br />}&lt;br />namespace bar {&lt;br /> typedef int y;&lt;br />}&lt;br />void test() {&lt;br /> foo::x a;&lt;br /> bar::y b;&lt;br /> a + b;&lt;br />}&lt;br />$ &lt;b>clang t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.cc:10:5: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('foo::x' and 'bar::y' (aka 'int'))&lt;br /> a + b;&lt;br /> ~ ^ ~&lt;br />$ &lt;b>gcc t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.cc: In function 'void test()':&lt;br />t.cc:10: error: no match for 'operator+' in 'a + b'&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />This shows that clang gives you the source names as you typed them ("foo::x" and "bar::y", respectively) but it also unwraps the y type with "aka" in case the underlying representation is important. Other compilers typically give completely unhelpful information which doesn't really tell you what the problem is. This is a surprisingly concise example from GCC, but it also seems to be missing some critical information (such as why there is no match). Also, if the expression was more than a single "a+b", you can imagine that pretty printing it back at you isn't the most helpful.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>&lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=6088150582281556517" name="most_vexing_parse">The Most Vexing Parse&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;br />One mistake many beginner programmers mistake is that they accidentally define functions instead of objects on the stack. This is due to an ambiguity in the C++ grammar which is resolved in an arbitrary way. This is an unavoidable part of C++, but at least the compiler should help you understand what is going wrong. Here's a trivial example:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>cat t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;vector&amp;gt;&lt;br />&lt;br />int foo() {&lt;br /> std::vector&amp;lt;std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; &amp;gt; X();&lt;br /> return X.size();&lt;br />}&lt;br />$ &lt;b>clang t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.cc:5:11: error: base of member reference has function type 'std::vector&amp;lt;std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; &amp;gt; ()'; perhaps you meant to call this function with '()'?&lt;br /> return X.size();&lt;br /> ^&lt;br /> ()&lt;br />$ &lt;b>gcc t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.cc: In function ‘int foo()’:&lt;br />t.cc:5: error: request for member ‘size’ in ‘X’, which is of non-class type ‘std::vector&amp;lt;std::vector&amp;lt;int, std::allocator&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; &amp;gt;, std::allocator&amp;lt;std::vector&amp;lt;int, std::allocator&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; ()()’&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />I run into this thing when I originally declared the vector as taking some arguments (e.g. "10" to specify an initial size) but refactor the code and eliminate that. Of course if you don't remove the parentheses, the code is actually declaring a function, not a variable.&lt;br />&lt;br />Here you can see that Clang points out fairly clearly that we've gone and declared a function (it even offers to help you call it in case you forgot ()'s). GCC, on the other hand, is both hopelessly confused about what you're doing, but also spews out a big typename that you didn't write (where did std::allocator come from?). It's sad but true that being an experienced C++ programmer really means that you're adept at decyphering the error messages that your compiler spews at you.&lt;br />&lt;br />If you go on to try the more classical example where this bites people, you can see Clang try even harder:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>cat t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;fstream&amp;gt;&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;vector&amp;gt;&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;iterator&amp;gt;&lt;br />&lt;br />int main() {&lt;br /> std::ifstream ifs("file.txt");&lt;br /> std::vector&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; v(std::istream_iterator&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;(ifs),&lt;br /> std::istream_iterator&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;());&lt;br /> &lt;br /> std::vector&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;::const_iterator it = v.begin();&lt;br /> return 0; &lt;br />}&lt;br />$ &lt;b>clang t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.cc:8:23: warning: parentheses were disambiguated as a function declarator&lt;br /> std::vector&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; v(std::istream_iterator&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;(ifs),&lt;br /> ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br />t.cc:11:45: error: member reference base type 'std::vector&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; (*)(std::istream_iterator&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;, std::istream_iterator&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; (*)())' is not a structure or union&lt;br /> std::vector&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;::const_iterator it = v.begin();&lt;br /> ~ ^&lt;br />$ &lt;b>gcc t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.cc: In function ‘int main()’:&lt;br />t.cc:11: error: request for member ‘begin’ in ‘v’, which is of non-class type&lt;br />‘std::vector&amp;lt;char, std::allocator&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; &amp;gt; ()(std::istream_iterator&amp;lt;char, char, std::char_traits&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;, long int&amp;gt;, std::istream_iterator&amp;lt;char, char, std::char_traits&amp;lt;char&amp;gt;, long int&amp;gt; (*)())’&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />In this case, Clang's second error isn't particularly great (though it does give much more concise type names), but it gives a really critical warning, telling you that the parens in the example are declaring a function, not being used as parens for an argument.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>&lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=6088150582281556517" name="missing_semicolons">Missing Semicolons&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;br />One error that I frequently make (perhaps due to the wildly inconsistent grammar of C++, or perhaps because I am sloppy and have a short attention span...) is dropping a semicolon. Fortunately these are pretty trivial to fix once you know what is going on, but they can lead to some really confusing error messages from some compilers. This happens even in cases where it is immediately obvious what is going on to a human (if they are paying attention!). For example:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>cat t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />struct foo { int x; }&lt;br />&lt;br />typedef int bar;&lt;br />$ &lt;b>clang t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.c:1:22: error: expected ';' after struct&lt;br />struct foo { int x; }&lt;br /> ^&lt;br /> ;&lt;br />$ &lt;b>gcc t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.c:3: error: two or more data types in declaration specifiers&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Note that GCC emits the error on the thing that &lt;em>follows the problem&lt;/em>. If the struct was the last thing at the end of a header, this means that you'll end up getting the error message &lt;em>in a completely different file&lt;/em> than where the problem lies. This problem also compounds itself in C++ (as do many others), for example:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>cat t2.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />template&amp;lt;class t&amp;gt;&lt;br />class a{}&lt;br />&lt;br />class temp{};&lt;br />a&amp;lt;temp&amp;gt; b;&lt;br />&lt;br />class b {&lt;br />}&lt;br />$ &lt;b>clang t2.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t2.cc:2:10: error: expected ';' after class&lt;br />class a{}&lt;br /> ^&lt;br /> ;&lt;br />t2.cc:8:2: error: expected ';' after class&lt;br />}&lt;br /> ^&lt;br /> ;&lt;br />$ &lt;b>gcc t2.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />t2.cc:4: error: multiple types in one declaration&lt;br />t2.cc:5: error: non-template type ‘a’ used as a template&lt;br />t2.cc:5: error: invalid type in declaration before ‘;’ token&lt;br />t2.cc:8: error: expected unqualified-id at end of input&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />In addition to emitting the confusing error "multiple types in one declaration", GCC goes on to confuse itself in other ways.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>&lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=6088150582281556517" name="dot_arrow_thinko">. vs -&amp;gt; Thinko&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;br />In C++ code, pointers and references often get used fairly interchangeably and it is common to use . where you mean -&amp;gt;. Clang recognizes this common sort of mistake and helps you out:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>cat t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;map&amp;gt;&lt;br />&lt;br />int bar(std::map&amp;lt;int, float&amp;gt; *X) {&lt;br /> return X.empty();&lt;br />}&lt;br />$ &lt;b>clang t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.cc:4:11: error: member reference type 'std::map&amp;lt;int, float&amp;gt; *' is a pointer; maybe you meant to use '-&amp;gt;'?&lt;br /> return X.empty();&lt;br /> ~^&lt;br /> -&amp;gt;&lt;br />$ &lt;b>gcc t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.cc: In function ‘int bar(std::map&amp;lt;int, float, std::less&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, std::allocator&amp;lt;std::pair&amp;lt;const int, float&amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt;*)’:&lt;br />t.cc:4: error: request for member ‘empty’ in ‘X’, which is of non-class type ‘std::map&amp;lt;int, float, std::less&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;, std::allocator&amp;lt;std::pair&amp;lt;const int, float&amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt;*’&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />In addition to helpfully informing you that your pointer is a "non-class type", it goes out of its way to spell the full definition of std::map out, which is certainly not helpful.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>&lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=6088150582281556517" name="scope_typo">:: vs : Typo&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;br />Perhaps it's just me, but I tend to make this mistake quite a bit, again while in a hurry. The C++ :: operator is used to separate nested name specifiers, but somehow I keep typing : instead. Here is a minimal example that shows the idea:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>cat t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />namespace x {&lt;br /> struct a { };&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />x:a a2;&lt;br />x::a a3 = a2;&lt;br />$ &lt;b>clang t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.cc:5:2: error: unexpected ':' in nested name specifier&lt;br />x:a a2;&lt;br /> ^&lt;br /> ::&lt;br />$ &lt;b>gcc t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.cc:5: error: function definition does not declare parameters&lt;br />t.cc:6: error: ‘a2’ was not declared in this scope&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />In addition to getting the error message right (and suggesting a fixit replacement to "::"), Clang "knows what you mean" so it handles the subsequent uses of a2 correctly. GCC, in contrast, gets confused about what the error is which leads it to emit bogus errors on every use of a2. This can be seen with a slightly elaborated example:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>cat t2.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />namespace x {&lt;br /> struct a { };&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />template &amp;lt;typename t&amp;gt;&lt;br />class foo {&lt;br />};&lt;br />&lt;br />foo&amp;lt;x::a&amp;gt; a1;&lt;br />foo&amp;lt;x:a&amp;gt; a2;&lt;br />&lt;br />x::a a3 = a2;&lt;br />$ &lt;b>clang t2.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t2.cc:10:6: error: unexpected ':' in nested name specifier&lt;br />foo&amp;lt;x:a&amp;gt; a2;&lt;br /> ^&lt;br /> ::&lt;br />t2.cc:12:6: error: no viable conversion from 'foo&amp;lt;x::a&amp;gt;' to 'x::a'&lt;br />x::a a3 = a2;&lt;br /> ^ ~~&lt;br />t2.cc:2:10: note: candidate constructor (the implicit copy constructor) not viable: no known conversion from 'foo&amp;lt;x::a&amp;gt;' to 'x::a const' for 1st argument&lt;br /> struct a { };&lt;br /> ^&lt;br />$ &lt;b>gcc t2.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t2.cc:10: error: template argument 1 is invalid&lt;br />t2.cc:10: error: invalid type in declaration before ‘;’ token&lt;br />t2.cc:12: error: conversion from ‘int’ to non-scalar type ‘x::a’ requested&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Here you can see that Clang's second error message is exactly right (and is explained). GCC gives a confusing follow on message about converting an "int" to x::a. Where did "int" come from?&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>&lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=6088150582281556517" name="near_hopeless">Helping out in near-hopeless situations&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;br />C++ is a power tool that gives you plenty of rope to shoot yourself in the foot as well as mix your multi-paradigmed metaphors. Unfortunately, this power gives you plenty of opportunities to find yourself in a near hopeless situation where you know "something is wrong" but have no idea what the real problem is or how to fix it. Thankfully, Clang tries to be there for you, even in the toughest of times. For example, here's a case involving ambiguous lookup:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>cat t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />struct B1 { void f(); };&lt;br />struct B2 { void f(double); };&lt;br />&lt;br />struct I1 : B1 { };&lt;br />struct I2 : B1 { };&lt;br />&lt;br />struct D: I1, I2, B2 {&lt;br /> using B1::f; using B2::f;&lt;br /> void g() {&lt;br /> f(); &lt;br /> }&lt;br />};&lt;br />$ &lt;b>clang t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.cc:10:5: error: ambiguous conversion from derived class 'D' to base class 'B1':&lt;br /> struct D -&amp;gt; struct I1 -&amp;gt; struct B1&lt;br /> struct D -&amp;gt; struct I2 -&amp;gt; struct B1&lt;br /> f(); &lt;br /> ^&lt;br />$ &lt;b>gcc t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.cc: In member function ‘void D::g()’:&lt;br />t.cc:10: error: ‘B1’ is an ambiguous base of ‘D’&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />In this case, you can see that not only does clang tell you that there is an ambiguity, it tells you &lt;em>exactly the paths through the inheritance hierarchy that are the problems&lt;/em>. When you're dealing with a non-trivial hierarchy, and all the classes aren't in a single file staring at you, this can be a real life saver.&lt;br />&lt;br />To be fair, GCC occasionally tries to help out. Unfortunately, when it does so it's not clear if it helps more than it hurts. For example, if you comment out the two using declarations in the example above you get:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>clang t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.cc:10:5: error: non-static member 'f' found in multiple base-class subobjects of type 'B1':&lt;br /> struct D -&amp;gt; struct I1 -&amp;gt; struct B1&lt;br /> struct D -&amp;gt; struct I2 -&amp;gt; struct B1&lt;br /> f(); &lt;br /> ^&lt;br />t.cc:1:18: note: member found by ambiguous name lookup&lt;br />struct B1 { void f(); };&lt;br /> ^&lt;br />$ &lt;b>gcc t.cc&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.cc: In member function ‘void D::g()’:&lt;br />t.cc:10: error: reference to ‘f’ is ambiguous&lt;br />t.cc:2: error: candidates are: void B2::f(double)&lt;br />t.cc:1: error: void B1::f()&lt;br />t.cc:1: error: void B1::f()&lt;br />t.cc:10: error: reference to ‘f’ is ambiguous&lt;br />t.cc:2: error: candidates are: void B2::f(double)&lt;br />t.cc:1: error: void B1::f()&lt;br />t.cc:1: error: void B1::f()&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />It looks like GCC is trying here, but why is it emitting two errors on line 10 and why is it printing B1::f twice in each? When I get these sort of errors (which is pretty rare, since I don't use multiple inheritance like this often) I really value clarity when unraveling what is going on.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;h2>&lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=6088150582281556517" name="merge_conflicts">One more thing... Merge Conflicts&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>&lt;br />Okay, this may be going a bit far, but how else are you going to fall completely in love with a compiler?&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ &lt;b>cat t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />void f0() {&lt;br />&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; HEAD&lt;br /> int x;&lt;br />=======&lt;br /> int y;&lt;br />&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; whatever&lt;br />}&lt;br />$ &lt;b>clang t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.c:2:1: error: version control conflict marker in file&lt;br />&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; HEAD&lt;br />^&lt;br />$ &lt;b>gcc t.c&lt;/b>&lt;br />t.c: In function ‘f0’:&lt;br />t.c:2: error: expected expression before ‘&amp;lt;&amp;lt;’ token&lt;br />t.c:4: error: expected expression before ‘==’ token&lt;br />t.c:6: error: expected expression before ‘&amp;gt;&amp;gt;’ token&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Yep, clang actually detects the merge conflict and parses one side of the conflict. You don't want to get tons of nonsense from your compiler on such a simple error, do you?&lt;br />&lt;br />Clang: crafted for real programmers who make might make the occasional mistake. Why settle for less?&lt;br />&lt;br />-Chris</description></item><item><title>Dragonegg Successfully Self-Hosts!</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/02/dragonegg-successfully-self-hosts.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2010 05:07:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/02/dragonegg-successfully-self-hosts.html</guid><description>
The &lt;a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org/">dragonegg GCC plugin&lt;/a> can host itself! Dragonegg lets you use the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM&lt;/a> optimizers with &lt;a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC-4.5&lt;/a>, much like &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/cmds/llvmgcc.html">llvm-gcc&lt;/a>, but unlike llvm-gcc does not involve modifying GCC, thanks to the new GCC plugin infrastructure (currently one small patch is required). We built all of GCC-4.5, LLVM and dragonegg with dragonegg, then used the resulting binaries to build them all again. Why? Because we love to build! And because this was a great way of checking that nothing was miscompiled. The final dragonegg plugin was fully functional, successfully passing the entire dragonegg test suite.</description></item><item><title>Clang Successfully Self-Hosts!</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/02/clang-successfully-self-hosts.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2010 19:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2010/02/clang-successfully-self-hosts.html</guid><description>

Disassemblers make binary analysis work. With a reliable disassembler, you can solve high-level problems like tracing back through a program's call stack or analyzing sample-based profiles to low-level problems like figuring out how your compiler unrolled a tight floating-point loop or what advantages declaring a variable const actually had at the other end of the optimization chain. A reliable disassembler, which takes sequences of bytes and prints human-readable instruction mnemonics, is a crucial part of any development platform. You're about to go on a whirlwind tour of the LLVM disassembler: why one should exist, what's great about this one, and how you can use it.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;h3>The case for an LLVM-based disassembler&lt;/h3>Disassemblers are all over the place. A disassembler you may well be familiar with is the disassembler from GNU gdb (&lt;a href="http://opensource.apple.com/source/gdb/gdb-1346/src/include/dis-asm.h">source&lt;/a>). In fact, any debugger needs one: Sun mdb has a disassembler too (&lt;a href="http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/cmd/mdb/common/mdb/mdb_disasm.h">source&lt;/a>). Some specialized applications like Dtrace need disassemblers as well (&lt;a href="http://src.opensolaris.org/source/xref/onnv/onnv-gate/usr/src/uts/intel/dtrace/fasttrap_isa.c">source&lt;/a>). So because this is well-traveled ground, there are several common properties you should expect from a disassembler:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>A large library can contain hundreds of thousands of instructions, so disassembly must be &lt;em>fast&lt;/em>.&lt;br />&lt;/li>&lt;li>A disassembler with a large memory footprint can steal memory and cache from analysis algorithms that need them more, so its code and data should be &lt;em>compact&lt;/em>.&lt;br />&lt;/li>&lt;li>Because disassemblers are used in a variety of applications, they should provide information about instructions in a &lt;em>generic&lt;/em>, preferably even architecture-independent form.&lt;br />&lt;/li>&lt;li>For the benefit of future code maintainers, disassemblers should be as &lt;em>table-driven&lt;/em> as possible.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Enter the LLVM MC architecture. In MC, instructions are represented using the architecture-independent &lt;code>MCInst&lt;/code> class (&lt;code>include/llvm/MC/MCInst.h&lt;/code>). The translation between MC instructions and machine code is specified by pre-existing &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/TableGenFundamentals.html">TableGen&lt;/a> tables (&lt;code>lib/Target/X86/X86.td&lt;/code> for x86 platforms). Writing a disassembler inside the MC framework makes sense because it solves the generality and table-driven problems naturally, but we still need to solve two problems: speed and compactness.&lt;br />&lt;h3>&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;">&lt;h3>Quick Testdrive of the Disassembler&lt;/h3>&lt;/span>&lt;/h3>&lt;br />The llvm-mc tool provides a simple command line wrapper around the disassembler that we primarily use for testing (e.g. &lt;span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">test/MC/Disassembler/simple-tests.txt&lt;/span>). &amp;nbsp;It reads a text file containing input bytes and prints out the instructions that correspond to those bytes. &amp;nbsp;For example, here's a simple transcript of using it:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>$ echo '1 2' | llvm-mc -disassemble -triple=x86_64-apple-darwin9&lt;br />addl %eax, (%rdx)&lt;br />$ echo '0x0f 0x1 0x9' | llvm-mc -disassemble -triple=x86_64-apple-darwin9&lt;br />sidt (%rcx)&lt;br />$ echo '0x0f 0xa2' | llvm-mc -disassemble -triple=x86_64-apple-darwin9&lt;br />cpuid&lt;br />$ echo '0xd9 0xff' | llvm-mc -disassemble -triple=i386-apple-darwin9&lt;br />fcos&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />&lt;div>&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold;">Design of the decode process&lt;/span>&lt;/div>Fast disassemblers can be classified into two categories, depending on the instruction format. On platforms with fixed-length instructions, it is possible to pull out all bits of the instruction at once and filter based on arbitrary ranges of those bits. In contrast, platforms with variable-length instructions require that the instruction be parsed byte by byte. In this article, I will discuss the variable-length case, and in particular the case of x86, which includes the &lt;code>i386&lt;/code> and &lt;code>x86_64&lt;/code> targets.&lt;br />The structure of an x86 instruction is determined by several important factors, each of which is of vital importance when decoding:&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>The &lt;em>context&lt;/em> of the instruction determines the meaning of the instruction and the size of its operands. The context includes the address and operand sizes of the instruction, as well as the presence (and position!) of prefixes such as the &lt;code>REX.w&lt;/code> prefix on &lt;code>x86_64&lt;/code> targets and the &lt;code>f3&lt;/code> prefix on architectures with SSE.&lt;br />&lt;/li>&lt;li>The &lt;em>opcode&lt;/em> of the instruction is of varying size, and determines what operands are required. Opcodes come in four different types: one-byte opcodes of the form &lt;code>xx&lt;/code>, two-byte opcodes of the form &lt;code>0f&lt;/code> &lt;code>xx&lt;/code>, three-byte opcodes of the form &lt;code>0f&lt;/code> &lt;code>38&lt;/code> &lt;code>xx&lt;/code>, and three-byte opcodes of the form &lt;code>0f&lt;/code>&lt;code>3a&lt;/code> &lt;code>xx&lt;/code>.&lt;br />&lt;/li>&lt;li>The &lt;em>addressing bytes&lt;/em> of the instruction determine the addressing mode of the instruction's memory operand (there is only one memory operand possible with a selectable mode). The addressing bytes include the ModR/M (Modifier - Register/Memory) byte and the SIB (Scale - Index - Base) byte.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;table border="1">&lt;tbody>&lt;tr> &lt;td>&lt;b class="phase2">&lt;span style="color: #339999;">Other prefixes?&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;/td> &lt;td>&lt;b class="phase2">&lt;span style="color: #339999;">Mandatory prefix?&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;/td> &lt;td>&lt;b class="phase2">&lt;span style="color: #339999;">REX prefix?&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;/td> &lt;td>&lt;b class="phase1">&lt;code>&lt;span style="color: #993399;">0f&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;span style="color: #993399;"> [&lt;/span>&lt;code>&lt;span style="color: #993399;">38&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;span style="color: #993399;">/&lt;/span>&lt;code>&lt;span style="color: #993399;">3a&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;span style="color: #993399;">]?&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;/td> &lt;td>&lt;b class="phase3">&lt;span style="color: #009900;">Opcode&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;/td> &lt;td>&lt;b class="phase4">&lt;span style="color: #3333ff;">ModR/M byte?&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;/td> &lt;td>&lt;b class="phase5">&lt;span style="color: #cc9933;">SIB byte?&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;/td> &lt;/tr>&lt;/tbody>&lt;/table>&lt;div class="caption">&lt;em>Table 1:&lt;/em> Portions of an instruction relevant to decode&lt;br />&lt;/div>You can read more about the meaning of all of these bytes in Chapter 2 of the Intel instruction manual, volume 2A (&lt;a href="http://www.intel.com/Assets/PDF/manual/253666.pdf">large PDF&lt;/a>). The x86 disassembler is structured around hierarchical tables that assume a 5-phase decode process. You can follow along with this discussion by looking at &lt;code>lib/Target/X86/Disassembler/X86DisassemblerDecoderCommon.h&lt;/code>, and the steps below are colored consistently with the data they access in Table 1.&lt;br />&lt;dl>&lt;dt>&lt;b class="phase1">&lt;span style="color: #993399;">Phase 1&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;/dt>&lt;dd>Record all prefixes but do not use them.

Look up this mask in a lookup table (&lt;code>&lt;b>&lt;span style="color: #cc9933;">CONTEXTS_SYM&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;/code>) to get a context ID. Consult the &lt;code>&lt;span style="color: #339999;">&lt;b>ContextDecision&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/code> to find the &lt;code>&lt;span style="color: #339999;">&lt;b>OpcodeDecision&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/code> that corresponds to the context. As the comments in the header point out, the many possible contexts are boiled down to &lt;code>&lt;span style="color: #339999;">&lt;b>IC_max&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/code> distinct context IDs that actually matter when decoding. This saves a lot of space. &lt;/dd>&lt;dt>&lt;b class="phase3">&lt;span style="color: #009900;">Phase 3&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;/dt>&lt;dd>Read the opcode and use it to consult the &lt;code>&lt;span style="color: #339999;">&lt;b>OpcodeDecision&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/code> to find the right &lt;code>&lt;span style="color: #339999;">&lt;b>ModRMDecision&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>. &lt;/dd>&lt;dt>&lt;b class="phase4">&lt;span style="color: #3333ff;">Phase 4&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;/dt>&lt;dd>The ModR/M byte not only specifies the addressing mode, but also sometimes serves to identify the specific instruction intended. For example, extended opcodes and escape opcodes (often seen in SSE) use the Reg/Opcode field in the ModR/M byte as part of the opcode. You can see these oddities in Chapters A.4 and A.5 of the Intel instruction manual, volume 2B (&lt;a href="http://www.intel.com/Assets/PDF/manual/253666.pdf">large PDF&lt;/a>). Given the value of the ModR/M byte, look up the LLVM opcode for the decoded instruction in the &lt;code>&lt;span style="color: #339999;">&lt;b>ModRMDecision&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>. &lt;/dd>&lt;dt>&lt;b class="phase5">&lt;span style="color: #cc9933;">Phase 5&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;/dt>&lt;dd>If the ModR/M byte indicates that an SIB byte is needed, read the SIB byte. This phase occurs as operands are read. &lt;/dd>&lt;/dl>Once these five steps have been performed, the disassembler consumes the operands, whose forms are now completely specified.&lt;br />&lt;h3>Using the disassemblers in real code&lt;/h3>If you want to use a disassembler in your own code, then &lt;code>tools/llvm-mc/Disassembler.cpp&lt;/code> is a good example of how to use one. You can instantiate a disassembler given a Target using the following code:&lt;br />&lt;pre>&lt;b class="namespace">&lt;span style="color: #6600cc;">llvm&lt;/span>&lt;/b>::&lt;b class="identifier">&lt;span style="color: #339999;">OwningPtr&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&amp;lt;&lt;b class="keyword">&lt;span style="color: #993399;">const&lt;/span>&lt;/b> &lt;b class="namespace">&lt;span style="color: #6600cc;">llvm&lt;/span>&lt;/b>::&lt;b class="identifier">&lt;span style="color: #339999;">MCDisassembler&lt;/span>&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;">&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;b class="identifier">&lt;span style="color: #339999;"> disassembler&lt;/span>&lt;/b>(&lt;b class="identifier">&lt;span style="color: #339999;">target&lt;/span>&lt;/b>.&lt;b class="function">&lt;span style="color: #336666;">createMCDisassembler&lt;/span>&lt;/b>());&lt;br />&lt;/pre>This disassembler works with &lt;code>&lt;b>&lt;span style="color: #339999;">MemoryObject&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;/code>s (&lt;code>include/llvm/Support/MemoryObject.h&lt;/code>), and you will need to subclass &lt;code>&lt;span style="color: #339999;">&lt;b>MemoryObject&lt;/b>&lt;/span>&lt;/code> to perform the proper reading functions.

The GCC Compiler supports a useful "&lt;a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Labels-as-Values.html#Labels-as-Values">Label as Values&lt;/a>" extension, which allows code to take the address of a label and then later do an unconditional branch to an address specified as a void*. This extension is particularly useful for building efficient interpreters.&lt;br />&lt;br />LLVM has long supported this extension by lowering it to a "correct" but extremely inefficient form. New in LLVM 2.7 is IR support for taking the address of a label and jumping to it later, which allows implementing this extension much more efficiently. This post describes this new LLVM IR feature and how it works.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;br />In this discussion, I limit the scope to only considering "local" jumps. We don't talk about non-local jumps in the GCC extension sense: jumps from a nested function to an outer one.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size: x-large;">The Address of Label Extension&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />Before I dive into the new feature, I'll describe the GCC C extension along with how LLVM 2.6 and earlier used to compile it. Consider this code (from &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3120">PR3120&lt;/a>):&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>static int fn(Opcodes opcodes) {&lt;br /> static const void *codetable[] =&lt;br /> { &amp;amp;&amp;amp;RETURN, &amp;amp;&amp;amp;INCREMENT, &amp;amp;&amp;amp;DECREMENT, &amp;amp;&amp;amp;DOUBLE, &amp;amp;&amp;amp;SWAPWORD };&lt;br /> int result = 0;&lt;br />&lt;br /> goto *codetable[*(opcodes++)];&lt;br />RETURN:&lt;br /> return result;&lt;br />INCREMENT:&lt;br /> result++;&lt;br /> goto *codetable[*(opcodes++)];&lt;br />DECREMENT:&lt;br /> result--;&lt;br /> goto *codetable[*(opcodes++)];&lt;br />DOUBLE:&lt;br /> result &amp;lt;&amp;lt;= 1;&lt;br /> goto *codetable[*(opcodes++)];&lt;br />SWAPWORD:&lt;br /> result = (result &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 16) | (result &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 16);&lt;br /> goto *codetable[*(opcodes++)];&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />As you can see, the code initializes the 'codetable' array with the addresses of 5 labels, and later jumps through a computed pointer.&lt;br />&lt;br />An interesting aspect about this extension is that the only thing you are allowed to do with an address taken label is to jump to it. While it is widely misused for other things (e.g. the BUG macro in the linux kernel, which prints the address of a label on error), you are &lt;b>really really&lt;/b> only allowed jump to it. You are not allowed to use it in an inline asm, inspect the value, or do anything else.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size: x-large;">LLVM 2.6 and Earlier&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />In LLVM 2.6 and earlier, LLVM took full advantage of the fact that you're not allowed to do anything with the value other than jump to the address of a label. Because this extension is only used rarely, we did not want to add direct support for this extension, because it would increase the complexity of LLVM IR. Instead, we took a very simple implementation approach, which faithfully implemented the extension, but did not require any new IR features. The approach was simple:&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>When the address of a label was taken, that label was assigned a unique integer ID (within its function) starting at 1. Taking the address of the label provided this integer ID, and not the actual address of the label.&lt;/li>&lt;li>When an indirect goto is seen, we lowered this construct as a standard LLVM &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#i_switch">switch instruction&lt;/a>. For each uniquely assigned integer ID, the switch would jump to the corresponding label.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>The combination of these two elements meant that we could support this extension with no special support in LLVM IR. To give a more concrete example, this is how the example above was lowered. The "codetable" array was lowered as if it were written as:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>static const void *codetable[] =&lt;br /> { (void*)1, (void*)2, (void*)3, (void*)4, (void*)5 };&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />This clearly doesn't provide the addresses of the specified labels, but it does provide unique ID numbers for each. With this, an indirect goto was lowered as if it were written as:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>switch (..) {&lt;br /> default: __builtin_unreachable();&lt;br /> case 1: goto RETURN;&lt;br /> case 2: goto INCREMENT;&lt;br /> case 3: goto DECREMENT:&lt;br /> case 4: goto DOUBLE;&lt;br /> case 5: goto SWAPWORD;&lt;br /> }&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Since code is only allowed to jump to the address of a label taken in the current function (again, not considering non-local gotos), we know all possible destinations, and we can codegen the indirect jump as a switch. To reiterate, the primary advantage of this approach was that it did not require any LLVM extension: switch statements required the LLVM IR switch instruction, so reusing it here was no problem.&lt;br />&lt;br />It is also worthwhile to point out that while this implementation fulfills the letter of the extension, it is fairly far from the intent of it. Beyond that, the major problem with the LLVM 2.6 implementation is that the generated code is quite slow.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size: x-large;">LLVM 2.7 and Later: blockaddress and indirectbr&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />While it is true that this extension is relatively rare, the cases where it is used are quite important. This extension is used in critical interpreter loops, where it can provide a fairly substantial win (around 15% is typical). Because of this, LLVM grew the ability to represent and codegen this in the intended form. This extension uses two new LLVM IR features:&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>First, taking the address of a label produces a new &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#blockaddress">blockaddress&lt;/a> node (represented by the LLVM BlockAddress class).&lt;/li>&lt;li>Second, jumping through an address results in a new &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#i_indirectbr">indirectbr&lt;/a> terminator instruction (the IndirectBrInst class).&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>The two new features have a couple of interesting ramifications, but before we get into them, I'll show you how the example above compiles. First, the "codetable" array compiles into this pseudo IR:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>static const void *codetable[] =&lt;br /> { blockaddress(@fn, %RETURN),&lt;br /> blockaddress(@fn, %INCREMENT),&lt;br /> blockaddress(@fn, %DECREMENT),&lt;br /> blockaddress(@fn, %DOUBLE),&lt;br /> blockaddress(@fn, %SWAPWORD)&lt;br /> };&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />At codegen time, the new blockaddress constant actually lowered into a reference to the label for the LLVM BasicBlock that it correspond to. Next, instead of a switch, indirect gotos codegen into the new 'indirectbr' LLVM IR instruction like this:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>indirectbr i8* %address, [ label %RETURN, label %DOUBLE, label %INCREMENT, label %DECREMENT, label %SWAPWORD ]&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />While the blockaddress constant is relatively straightforward, you might be surprised to see all of the labels duplicated here. The 'indirectbr' is typically lowered to very simple machine code: a machine level jump through a register. Despite this underlying simplicity, the invariant on the "indirectbr" instruction is that it must include (possibly a superset of) all possible label targets in the list of labels in the instruction. Jumping to a label that is not included is undefined behavior. The order of labels in the instruction doesn't matter, but the presence or absence of a label is important.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size: x-large;">Ramifications of this design&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />When this feature was being added to LLVM, we considered many different approaches, which all had a variety of different tradeoffs. Instead of describing all possible implementation approaches, lets just talk about some of the ramifications of this approach by considering a set of questions you might have:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Why does indirectbr include a list of possible target blocks?&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />One of the foremost concerns we had when implementing this new feature was that we wanted it to fit into the rest of the compiler with as little special case code as possible. One particularly important structure is the Control Flow Graph (CFG), which is the basis for all dataflow analysis in LLVM.&lt;br />&lt;br />In LLVM, the CFG is walked with the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/ProgrammersManual.html#iterate_preds">pred_iterator and succ_iterator&lt;/a> iterators. &lt;tt>succ_iterator&lt;/tt> is very simple, it just walks the BasicBlock operands of the &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#terminators">terminator instruction&lt;/a> at the end of a block. &lt;tt>pred_iterator&lt;/tt> is trickier: it walks the use-def chains of a BasicBlock, and reports any uses coming from terminators as predecessors.&lt;br />&lt;br />Clearly, for this extension to work with this scheme, we wanted to follow as closely as possible with the way the existing system works. This means that indirectbr having a list of possible targets makes the successor iterator very simple (it can just walk the list to get the possible destinations). A second major benefit is that this also fixes the predecessor iterator: since each operand is considered a 'use', walking the use list of a block that has its address taken will work correctly, because the indirectbr uses will be seen.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>How does this extension interact with PHI nodes?&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />PHI nodes are defined based on properties of the CFG, so they work normally as you'd expect based on the CFG behavior described above. Taking the address of a block itself doesn't cause it to have any PHI nodes. An address-taken block gets PHI node entries when an indirectbr jumps to it.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Why is blockaddress a constant?&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />This is an easy one: the BlockAddress IR object inherits from Constant because it needs to be able to be used to initialize global variables. Global variable initializers must be Constant's.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Why does blockaddress take both a function and a basic block name?&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />There are a couple answers to this. The most obvious one is that LLVM IR is not nested like C code is. When the address of a label is used to initialize a static variable, that static variable becomes an LLVM global variable like any other. If there were a reference to "foo" from a global variable, we need to know &lt;i>which&lt;/i> "foo" label is being referenced (since each function has its own local namespace).&lt;br />&lt;br />A second and less obvious answer is that LLVM IR is more general than the GCC C extension: you are allowed to take the address of a block in a different function. This support falls out of the support we need to initialize global variables, and isn't obviously useful, but it is there nonetheless.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>How does this extension interact with inlining?&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />Simply put, LLVM currently refuses to inline a function containing an indirectbr (as does GCC). It is conceivably possible to relax this restriction in the future in some cases, but it would require a lot of analysis. The basic problem is that inlining an indirectbr is actually a pretty tricky thing to do: in addition to cloning the callee into the caller, we have to clone all blockaddress objects referring to block in the caller, and clone everything that refers to them. Here's a silly example in pseudo IR:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>static void *G = blockaddress(@foo, %bb);&lt;br />void foo() {&lt;br /> goto *G;&lt;br />bb:&lt;br /> return;&lt;br />}&lt;br />void bar() {&lt;br /> foo();&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Simply cloning foo into bar like this would not be correct:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>static void *G = blockaddress(@foo, %bb);&lt;br />void foo() {&lt;br /> goto *G;&lt;br />bb: return;&lt;br />}&lt;br />void bar() {&lt;br /> goto *G;&lt;br />bb:&lt;br /> return;&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />The problem is that 'bar' would jump through G to a label defined in 'foo'. It is not legal to jump from one function to another. To do this inlining, we'd actually have to clone G itself. Doing this is possible, but not worth it, particularly because most functions that use this extension are large interpreter loops.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>How does this extension interact with critical edge splitting?&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />Poorly.&lt;br />&lt;br />A critical edge in the CFG is an edge which comes from a block with multiple successors (e.g. a block that ends with a conditional branch) and goes to a block with multiple predecessors (like the merge point of an if/then/else). Critical edges are problematic for various code motion transformations. Prior to this extension, any critical edge in the CFG could be split by introducing a new intermediate block between the source and destination blocks. &lt;br />&lt;br />My biggest disappointment with this extension (and the reason I resisted implementing it for so long) centers around the fact that it inherently makes some edges un-splittable. Consider a simple little CFG like this:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>BB1:&lt;br /> indirectbr i8* %P1, [ label %A, label %B ]&lt;br />BB2:&lt;br /> br label %A&lt;br />A:&lt;br /> ...&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />The edge "BB1-&amp;gt;A" is critical because A has multiple predecessors (from both BB1 and BB2) and BB1 has multiple successors (to A and B). We could easily split the edge in this example by introducing a new intermediary block:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>BB1:&lt;br /> indirectbr i8* %P1, [ label %A1, label %B ]&lt;br />BB2:&lt;br /> br label %A&lt;br />A1:&lt;br /> br label %A&lt;br />A:&lt;br /> ...&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />This is the normal critical-edge splitting transformation. Here we can see that the edge from BB1-&amp;gt;A1 is not critical (because A1 has one predecessor) and the edge from A1-&amp;gt;A is not critical either (because A1 has one predecessor). The problem with this is that we just broke an important invariant: since we didn't adjust places that took the address of A, we now have a situation where the CFG looks like BB1 jumps to A1 - but in reality, the pointer that the indirectbr gets will contain the address of A. This will cause us to do invalid dataflow analysis and lead to all sorts of problems.&lt;br />&lt;br />As with inlining, it is possible to teach the optimizer to be able to split some critical edges. However, this isn't enough. If there is a single critical edge that the optimizer may not be able to split it means that various LLVM optimizations have to assume that critical edge splitting can fail. This had some significant effects on the loop optimizer, for example, which assumed that it could split critical edges to form canonical loops.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Can we get an N^2 explosion of CFG edges?&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />Absolutely. The issue here is that you can have N indirect branch instructions (in the example at the top, N = 5) and M labels with their addresses taken (in the example, M = 5). Since each indirectbr needs an edge to each label with its address taken, you get N*M edges, which is N^2. This can quickly become a big compile time problem, because it is fairly common for big interpreters to have hundreds of these things in their loops.&lt;br />&lt;br />Fortunately, the fix for this is pretty simple: while the optimizer can safely duplicate an indirectbr instruction, it decides that it isn't profitable to do so. By trying to maintain at most one indirectbr instruction per function, we effectively get a factoring of the edges. The llvm-gcc and clang frontends both generate IR which has at most one indirectbr instruction per function: all other indirect gotos are lowered as a branch to the communal indirectbr in a function.&lt;br />&lt;br />In order to produce efficient code, the code generator performs tail duplication to introduce the N^2 CFG. It does this early enough to get good code but late enough to not impact compile time too much. &lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>What about labels whose address is taken but not branched to?&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />Circling back to the Linux BUG macro and other abuses of this extension, it is natural to wonder whether we support these uses better than LLVM 2.6. The answer is "sort of". In cases where code takes the address of a block and has an indirectbr in a function, that address will persist and other uses will have the expected behavior: They will see the address of a block and not some magic block ID number.&lt;br />&lt;br />However, this typically isn't good enough. The issue is that taking the address of a block is not enough to prevent other optimizations (like block merging) from affecting it, it needs to have predecessors in the CFG. If we ever decide to better support abuses like this, we will need to extend our model to support them somehow. &lt;br />&lt;br />In any case, I hope this discussion about indirectbr is helpful and illuminating. Interpreter loops will be much more performant with LLVM 2.7 than with LLVM 2.6 and earlier!&lt;br />&lt;br />-Chris</description></item><item><title>Clang Builds LLVM</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2009/12/clang-builds-llvm.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2009 13:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2009/12/clang-builds-llvm.html</guid><description>

In our &lt;a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2009/12/introduction-to-load-elimination-in-gvn.html">previous post on GVN&lt;/a> we introduced some basics of load elimination. &amp;nbsp;This post describes some advanced topics and focuses on PHI translation: what it is, why it is important, shows some nice things it can do, and describes the implementation in LLVM.&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size: x-large;">What is PHI Translation All About?&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />When performing redundancy elimination on SSA form,&amp;nbsp;PHI translation is required when we are walking through the CFG and the value being analyzed has an operand defined in the block we're walking through. &amp;nbsp;In the case of load elimination, the operand of the value being analyzed is the pointer we're loading from. This means that PHI translation happens when the pointer we're loading is defined in a block. For example, consider this C code:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>if (...) {&lt;br /> *A = 5;&lt;br /> P = A;&lt;br /> } else {&lt;br /> *B = 9;&lt;br /> P = B;&lt;br /> }&lt;br /> use(*P);&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />This compiles into LLVM IR that looks like this:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>BB1:&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;store i32 5, i32* %A&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;br label %Merge&lt;br />&lt;br />BB2:&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;store i32 9, i32* %B&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;br label %Merge&lt;br />&lt;br />Merge:&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;%P = phi i32* [%A, %BB1], [%B, %BB2]&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;%Y = load i32 *%P&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;... use %Y ...&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />In this example, GVN starts looking at the %Y load to see if it can eliminate it. &amp;nbsp;It scans backwards up the block, looking for other things that provide the value of the memory address at %P. &amp;nbsp;Unlike in the example in the previous post, here we actually find a definition of %P: what do we do?&lt;br />&lt;br />In LLVM 2.6 and before, memory dependence analysis would just give up and act as though the memory had been clobbered, preventing the load from being analyzed further (and eventually being eliminated in this case). &amp;nbsp;New in LLVM 2.7, GVN is able to translate %P into each predecessor. &amp;nbsp;In this case, it sees that %P has the value of %A in %BB1 (and then sees that %A is available there) and that %P has the value of %B in %BB2 (where it is also available). This allows GVN to optimize this example into:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>BB1:&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;store i32 5, i32* %A&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;br label %Merge&lt;br />&lt;br />BB2:&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;store i32 9, i32* %B&lt;/pre>&lt;pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;br label %Merge&lt;br />&lt;br />Merge:&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;%Y = phi i32 [5, %BB1], [9, %BB2]&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;%P = phi i32* [%A, %BB1], [%B, %BB2]&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;... use %Y ...&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />which eliminates the load. This post talks about how this is done, the nuances involved in getting this right, and what this allows us to optimize.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size: x-large;">Why is PHI Translation Required for Correctness?&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />One thing that wasn't obvious to me when I dove into this is that PHI translation is actually required for correctness. &amp;nbsp;This is the reason why memory dependence analysis must stop scanning if it finds the definition of the pointer. &amp;nbsp;The cases where this happen are somewhat subtle and usually involve partial redundancy elimination. &amp;nbsp;For example, consider this loop:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>Loop:&lt;br /> %P = phi i32* [%A, %Entry], [%B, %Loop]&lt;br /> %X = load i32* %P&lt;br /> ...&lt;br /> store i32 5, i32* %B&lt;br /> store i32 4, i32* %P&lt;br /> br i1 %cond, label %Loop, label %Out&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Consider what would happen if PHI translation kept scanning for %P in predecessors as it went up the CFG: it would scan from the %X load up to the top of the Loop block. If not doing PHI translation correctly, it would continue scanning for %P in the Entry block (which we ignore in this example), then scan for %P in the Loop block (which is a predecessor of itself).&lt;br />&lt;br />Scanning for %P in the loop block finds the store of 4 to %P, so we'd consider 4 to be a live-in value on the edge from loop. However, this is &lt;b>incorrect&lt;/b> and will lead to a miscompilation: the actual value live on that backedge is 5, which is provided by the previous store.&lt;br />&lt;br />This simple example is intended to show that PHI translation is not an optimization: it is required for correctness, and that the most simple form of PHI translation is to give up when you see a definition of the address. However, LLVM recently got smart enough to do much better than this or the simple pointer case above.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size: x-large;">A More Interesting Case&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />Consider this test case:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>struct S { int X, Y; };&lt;br />&lt;br />int foo(struct S *P1, struct S *P2, int C) {&lt;br /> struct S *P;&lt;br /> if (C) {&lt;br /> P1-&amp;gt;X = 4;&lt;br /> P1-&amp;gt;Y = 2;&lt;br /> P = P1;&lt;br /> } else {&lt;br /> P2-&amp;gt;X = 24;&lt;br /> P2-&amp;gt;Y = 2;&lt;br /> P = P2;&lt;br /> }&lt;br /> return P-&amp;gt;X + P-&amp;gt;Y;&lt;br />} &lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />This code compiles down to IR that looks like this (using "&lt;tt>clang t.c -S -o - -emit-llvm | opt -mem2reg -S&lt;/tt>":&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>if.then:&lt;br /> %tmp2 = getelementptr inbounds %struct.S* %P1, i32 0, i32 0&lt;br /> store i32 4, i32* %tmp2&lt;br /> %tmp4 = getelementptr inbounds %struct.S* %P1, i32 0, i32 1&lt;br /> store i32 2, i32* %tmp4&lt;br /> br label %if.end&lt;br />&lt;br />if.else: &lt;br /> %tmp7 = getelementptr inbounds %struct.S* %P2, i32 0, i32 0&lt;br /> store i32 24, i32* %tmp7&lt;br /> %tmp9 = getelementptr inbounds %struct.S* %P2, i32 0, i32 1 &lt;br /> store i32 2, i32* %tmp9&lt;br /> br label %if.end&lt;br />&lt;br />if.end: &lt;br /> %P = phi %struct.S* [ %P1, %if.then ], [ %P2, %if.else ] &lt;br /> %tmp12 = getelementptr inbounds %struct.S* %P, i32 0, i32 0 &lt;br /> %tmp13 = load i32* %tmp12 &lt;br /> %tmp15 = getelementptr inbounds %struct.S* %P, i32 0, i32 1 &lt;br /> %tmp16 = load i32* %tmp15 &lt;br /> %add = add nsw i32 %tmp13, %tmp16 &lt;br /> ret i32 %add&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />In this case, GVN looks to eliminate the %tmp13 and %tmp14 loads. &amp;nbsp;Consider the %tmp13 load: it scans backwards from the load, looking for available values of %tmp12. &amp;nbsp;As it goes, it immediately finds the definition of the pointer (%tmp12), so it needs to PHI translate the pointer or give up. &amp;nbsp;Without getting into the details yet of how this is done, here is the intuition of what happens:&lt;br />&lt;br />In this case, the pointer is not a PHI node, but it &lt;b>uses&lt;/b> a PHI node as an operand. &amp;nbsp;Because of this, GVN needs to phi translate the entire symbolic expression "gep P, 0, 0" into the predecessors. &amp;nbsp;It does this, forming the symbolic expression "gep P1, 0, 0" and it finds that the phi translated address is available as %tmp2 in the %if.then block. &amp;nbsp;It then PHI translates the "gep P, 0, 0" expression into the %if.else forming the "gep P2, 0, 0" symbolic expression and finds that it is available as %tmp7. &amp;nbsp;It scans those blocks for the pointers and finds that the values are, in fact, available. &amp;nbsp;Because they are both available, it can use insert construct SSA form to eliminate the load.&lt;br />&lt;br />This allows it to see the both loads are in fact available in the predecessors. &amp;nbsp;Here is the code after GVN (using "&lt;tt>clang t.c -S -o - -emit-llvm | opt -mem2reg -S -gvn -die&lt;/tt>):&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>if.then:&lt;br /> %tmp2 = getelementptr inbounds %struct.S* %P1, i32 0, i32 0&lt;br /> store i32 4, i32* %tmp2&lt;br /> %tmp4 = getelementptr inbounds %struct.S* %P1, i32 0, i32 1&lt;br /> store i32 2, i32* %tmp4&lt;br /> br label %if.end&lt;br />&lt;br />if.else:&lt;br /> %tmp7 = getelementptr inbounds %struct.S* %P2, i32 0, i32 0&lt;br /> store i32 24, i32* %tmp7&lt;br /> %tmp9 = getelementptr inbounds %struct.S* %P2, i32 0, i32 1&lt;br /> store i32 2, i32* %tmp9&lt;br /> br label %if.end&lt;br />&lt;br />if.end:&lt;br /> %tmp13 = phi i32 [ 1, %if.then ], [ 2, %if.else ]&lt;br /> %tmp16 = phi i32 [ 3, %if.then ], [ 4, %if.else ]&lt;br /> %add = add nsw i32 %tmp13, %tmp16&lt;br /> ret i32 %add&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Here you can see that GVN found the available values, inserted PHI nodes, and eliminated the loads.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size: x-large;">More Complex Address Expressions&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />While the example above hopefully makes intuitive sense, it turns out that PHI translating expressions like this is actually a bit more difficult than it looks. It was so much so that it got split out into its own class, &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1PHITransAddr.html">PHITransAddr&lt;/a> (in &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/PHITransAddr_8h-source.html">llvm/Analysis/PHITransAddr.h&lt;/a>). Doing this was actually motivated by a few cute little examples like this:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>void test(int N, double* G) {&lt;br /> for (long j = 1; j &amp;lt; 1000; j++)&lt;br /> G[j] = G[j] + G[j-1];&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />This example&amp;nbsp;(which was reduced from a larger example)&amp;nbsp;has a loop carried redundancy where every iteration reads the previous iteration's value. In fact, the code could be rewritten like this, which only has one load in the loop:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>void test(int N, double* G) {&lt;br /> double Prev = G[0];&lt;br /> for (long j = 1; j &amp;lt; 1000; j++) {&lt;br /> Prev = G[j] + Prev;&lt;br /> G[j] = Prev;&lt;br /> }&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Some compilers have specific optimization passes that identify and eliminate these recurrences through dependence analysis. While this is a nice thing to do, sufficiently smart partial redundancy elimination of loads should also be able to eliminate this, and LLVM now does.&lt;br />&lt;br />The unoptimized code looks like this in LLVM IR:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>define void @test(i32 %N, double* %G) {&lt;br />bb.nph:&lt;br /> br label %for.body&lt;br />&lt;br />for.body:&lt;br /> %indvar = phi i64 [ 0, %bb.nph ], [ %tmp, %for.body ] ; &lt;b>indvar = [0 ... 999]&lt;/b>&lt;br /> %arrayidx6 = getelementptr double* %G, i64 %indvar&lt;br /> %tmp = add i64 %indvar, 1&lt;br /> %arrayidx = getelementptr double* %G, i64 %tmp&lt;br /> %tmp3 = load double* %arrayidx ;

&lt;b>Inserted by PRE&lt;/b>&lt;br /> br label %for.body&lt;br />&lt;br />for.body:&lt;br /> %tmp7 = phi double [ %tmp7.pre, %bb.nph ],&lt;br /> [ %add, %for.body ] ; &lt;b>SSA Construction&lt;/b>&lt;br /> %indvar = phi i64 [ 0, %bb.nph ], [ %tmp, %for.body ]&lt;br /> %arrayidx6 = getelementptr double* %G, i64 %indvar&lt;br /> %tmp = add i64 %indvar, 1&lt;br /> %arrayidx = getelementptr double* %G, i64 %tmp&lt;br /> %tmp3 = load double* %arrayidx&lt;br /> %add = fadd double %tmp3, %tmp7 ; &lt;b>Now uses the PHI instead of a load&lt;/b>&lt;br /> store double %add, double* %arrayidx&lt;br /> %exitcond = icmp eq i64 %tmp, 999&lt;br /> br i1 %exitcond, label %for.end, label %for.body&lt;br />&lt;br />for.end:&lt;br /> ret void&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Through this, GVN and PHI translation have worked together to eliminate a load in the loop. &amp;nbsp;If you're more comfortable reading X86 machine code, here is the before and after code for the loop:&lt;br />&lt;br />Before:&lt;br />&lt;pre>LBB1_1:&lt;br /> movsd 8(%rsi,%rax,8), %xmm0 # Load&lt;br /> addsd (%rsi,%rax,8), %xmm0 # Load&lt;br /> movsd %xmm0, 8(%rsi,%rax,8) # Store&lt;br /> incq %rax&lt;br /> cmpq $999, %rax&lt;br /> jne LBB1_1&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />After:&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: monospace;

If it does not find a dependent instruction it returns "nonlocal" to indicate that the loaded memory value is potentially live-in to the block.&lt;br />&lt;br />2) "give me all the non-local dependences for a load that is live in to a block". This query does the recursive upwards CFG scan that does PHI translation to find other definitions of the value.&lt;br />&lt;br />In the interesting cases for PHI translation, we end up doing a non-local query and get back a set of blocks where the value is available along with a set of blocks where the value isn't available.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>Alias Analysis:&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/AliasAnalysis.html">Alias analysis&lt;/a> (in this case, the -basicaa pass) is the underlying analysis that tells us whether two pointers can point to the same memory location or whether an instruction can modify or read from a memory location. &amp;nbsp;This is required to allow MemDep to scan beyond stores and calls that do not clobber the address we're interested in.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>SSA Update:&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />The &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/SSAUpdater_8h-source.html">SSAUpdater&lt;/a> class is used to insert PHI nodes based on the set of loads that we find are available.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;b>GVN&lt;/b>:&lt;br />&lt;br />The GVN pass is the transformation sitting on top of all of these subsystems. &amp;nbsp;Because it is based on these other facilities, its logic is relatively simple: First, do a non-local memdep query. &amp;nbsp;If it returns a set of definitions with no clobbers, then the load is fully redundant and can be eliminated. &amp;nbsp;Otherwise, if there are some definitions live in, we have a partially redundant case. &amp;nbsp;GVN handles inserting the new computation to make the value fully redundant.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">&lt;span style="font-size: x-large;">Limitations&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;br />While there is a lot of power here, there are still some significant limitations to this system. &amp;nbsp;As of this writing, here are some of the most significant ones:&lt;br />&lt;br />First, an symbolic expression address must exist as an SSA value for PHI translation to succeed. &amp;nbsp;In the last example, if we tried to phi translate "gep %G, %indvar" into a predecessor value which formed the symbolic expression of "gep %G, %xxx" and that symbolic expression did not actually exist in the code, PHI translation would fail. &amp;nbsp;This happens because because after PHI translation occurs, we need MemDep to scan the block to find dependent instructions. &amp;nbsp;Since MemDep queries are based on pointer values expressed as LLVM 'Value*'s, we have to have one to do the query.&lt;br />&lt;br />Second, critical edges currently block PRE of loads because we do not want to introduce the load on a control flow path where it would not exist before. &amp;nbsp;In principle, we could do this by lazily splitting the edge, but this would require updating the other in-flight data structures that the GVN pass is maintaining and we don't do this yet.&lt;br />&lt;br />Finally, our PRE of loads can certainly be improved. &amp;nbsp;Currently we only do PRE in cases where it would not grow the code and not introduce a computation on a path where it wouldn't exist before. &amp;nbsp;Since we are deleting a load, this means that we only want to insert at most one load. &amp;nbsp;The heuristic we use to determine whether this is the case is currently very local and can be improved.&lt;br />&lt;br />In any case, I hope this gives an useful overview of how this subsystem in LLVM works, and how it got better in what will be LLVM 2.7.&lt;br />&lt;br />-Chris</description></item><item><title>The Dreaded Two-Phase Name Lookup</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2009/12/dreaded-two-phase-name-lookup.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2009 14:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2009/12/dreaded-two-phase-name-lookup.html</guid><description>
C++ has more than its fair share of dark, dank corners, especially where templates are concerned. One of the most vexing is "two-phase name lookup", which involves lookup for any names that occur in the body of a template. As you might expect, there are two different phases of templates:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;div>&lt;ol>&lt;li>Template definition time: when the template is initially parsed, long before it is instantiated, the compiler parses the template and looks up any "non-dependent" names. A name is "non-dependent" if the results of name lookup do not depend on any template parameters, and therefore will be the same from one template instantiation to another.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Template instantiation time: when the template is instantiated, the compiler looks up any "dependent" names, now that it has the full set of template arguments to perform lookup. The results of this lookup can (and often do!) vary from one template instantiation to another.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;/div>&lt;div>Two-phase name lookup is not as complicated as its reputation implies. There are some non-obvious rules in the determination of what is a dependent vs. a non-dependent name, but otherwise the idea is simple. The problem with two-phase name lookup is that current compiler support for this feature is very poor. For example, GCC implements two-phase name lookup relatively well, but occasionally delays lookups that should have been done at template definition time (phase 1) until template instantiation time or performs lookups in both phases when it shouldn't. Visual C++, on the other hand, has a template parsing model that delays nearly every lookup to instantiation time (phase 2). By not implementing two-phase name lookup fully, both compilers tend to accept incorrect template code, and in some cases will end up compiling code differently from the mythical fully-conforming compiler. This is a portability issue, both between those two compilers (Visual C++ is more lenient) and to other, more pedantic compilers.&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Like Clang. Clang was designed with complete support for two-phase name lookup, parsing template definitions (phase 1) as completely as possible and only performing name lookup at template instantiation time (phase 2) when required. Since we have chosen to make Clang C++ strict, we end up diagnosing template problems that other compilers miss. While that's generally good---correct code is more portable code---it also means that Clang needs to try extra-hard to produce decent diagnostics. Here's a recent problem Clang found within the LLVM code base (which compiled with GCC):&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;div>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote>&lt;div>In file included from llvm/lib/Analysis/AliasAnalysisCounter.cpp:16:&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>In file included from llvm/include/llvm/Pass.h:369:&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>In file included from llvm/include/llvm/PassAnalysisSupport.h:24:&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>llvm/include/llvm/ADT/SmallVector.h:317:7:&lt;/b>&lt;b>&lt;span style="color: red;"> error: &lt;span style="color: black; font-weight: normal;">use of undeclared identifier 'setEnd'&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>setEnd(this-&amp;gt;end()+1);&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="color: #33ff33;"> ^&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="color: #33ff33;"> this-&amp;gt;&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>In file included from llvm/lib/Analysis/AliasAnalysisCounter.cpp:16:&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>In file included from llvm/include/llvm/Pass.h:369:&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>llvm/include/llvm/PassAnalysisSupport.h:56:14: note: &lt;span style="font-weight: normal;">in instantiation of member function 'llvm::SmallVectorImpl llvm::PassInfo const *&amp;gt;::push_back' requested here&lt;/span>&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Required.push_back(ID);&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="color: #33ff33;"> ^&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>In file included from llvm/lib/Analysis/AliasAnalysisCounter.cpp:16:&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>In file included from llvm/include/llvm/Pass.h:369:&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>In file included from llvm/include/llvm/PassAnalysisSupport.h:24:&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b>llvm/include/llvm/ADT/SmallVector.h:105:8: note: &lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;b> must qualify identifier to find this declaration in dependent base class&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>void setEnd(T *P) { this-&amp;gt;EndX = P; }&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="color: #33ff33;"> ^&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;/blockquote>&lt;div>&lt;/div>&lt;div>The problem itself is in SmallVectorImpl, in the call to setEnd(). The actual setEnd() function isn't in SmallVectorImpl, but in a base class, so we have a situation that looks like this:&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote>&lt;div>template&amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>class SmallVectorTemplateCommon {&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>protected:&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span> void setEnd(T *P);&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>};&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;/div>&lt;div>template&amp;lt;typename T&amp;gt;&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>class SmallVectorImpl : public SmallVectorTemplateCommon&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; {&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>public:&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span> void push_back(const T&amp;amp; value) {&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span> &lt;span style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span> // ...&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span> &lt;span style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span> setEnd(this-&amp;gt;end() + 1);&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span style="white-space: pre;"> &lt;/span> }&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>};&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;/blockquote>&lt;div>&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>If we weren't in a template, this code would be fine, because we would find setEnd in our base class. However, because we're in a template we're dealing with two-phase name lookup. While parsing push_back(), the compiler performs name lookup for the name "setEnd" at phase 1: however, it can't find anything because it isn't allowed to look into the dependent base class SmallVectorTemplateCommon&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;. However, this code is still valid: "setEnd" is taken as the name of a non-member function, which could be found at instantiation time via Argument Dependent Lookup. Unfortunately, when we do get around to instantiating push_back, Argument Dependent Lookup doesn't look into our base class, so Clang gives us a "use of undeclared identifier" error.&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>By itself, that error would leave the programmer scratching her head. GCC and Visual C++ accepted this code, and setEnd() is &lt;i>obviously&lt;/i> in the base class, so what gives? To help out a bit, Clang gives more detail:&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;ol>&lt;li>The note at the very end, which reads "must qualify identifier to find this declaration in dependent base class," tells the programmer what declaration Clang could find... if only she were to qualify the name somehow so that Clang were allowed to look there.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The original error had a little hint below the caret diagnostic, in green, providing advice on how to fix this particular issue. By adding "this-&amp;gt;", we tell the compiler that "setEnd" is in the current class or one of its (possibly dependent) base classes, to be found at template instantiation time.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;/div>&lt;div>Clang C++ is designed to be a strict but helpful compiler, following the letter of the C++ standard to help programmers make sure that their code is portable. We also hope to make Clang a friendly compiler, that can use its knowledge of the program and the C++ language to help programmers get past portability problems like this one. And maybe, just maybe, Clang can shine a little light into the dark, scary corners of C++.&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Introduction to load elimination in the GVN pass</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2009/12/introduction-to-load-elimination-in-gvn.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2009 23:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2009/12/introduction-to-load-elimination-in-gvn.html</guid><description>
One very important optimization that the GVN pass (opt -gvn) does is load elimination.&amp;nbsp;Load elimination involves several subsystems (including alias analysis, memory dependence analysis,&amp;nbsp;SSA construction, PHI translation) and&amp;nbsp;has many facets (full vs partial redundancy elimination, value coercion, handling memset/memcpy, etc). &amp;nbsp;In this post, I introduce and motivate the topic, which will let us expand on it in future posts.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size: x-large;">Basic Redundant Load Elimination&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />GVN (which stands for "Global Value Numbering", though this detail has nothing to do with load elimination) is responsible for the&amp;nbsp;form of load elimination&amp;nbsp;known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>redundant&lt;/b> load elimination. &amp;nbsp;This is the elimination of loads whose values are already available (other forms of load elimination includes deletion of &lt;b>dead&lt;/b> loads). &amp;nbsp;A simple example of a redundant load is:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;%x = load i32* %P&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;%y = load i32* %P ; &amp;lt;- Redundant&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Clearly in this example, we can delete the second load and "replace all uses" of %y with %x, because the value at address %p is already available as the value "i32 %x". Another simple form of redundant elimination comes about from stores, as in:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;store i32 4, i32* %P&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;%a = load i32* %P&lt;/pre>&lt;br />In this example, we can replace %a with 4. &amp;nbsp;This sort of transformation generalizes to support other operations: the GVN pass can forward memsets to loads, memcpy from constant globals to loads, etc. &amp;nbsp;Note that GVN is not allowed to optimize away volatile loads.&lt;br />&lt;br />The implementation of this is pretty straight-forward: GVN (through the memdep class) scans backwards from the load that we are trying to eliminate up through the block until it gets an instruction that provides the value (as in these examples) or until it finds an instruction that might affect the memory in an unknown way like a call. &amp;nbsp;If we find an instruction that potentially clobbers the memory location, we can't eliminate the load.&lt;br />&lt;br />However, straight-line code is pretty boring, lets look at more complex examples.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size: x-large;">SSA Construction in GVN&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />GVN can also eliminate non-local loads, which can require PHI node insertion. &amp;nbsp;Here's a simple example:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>BB1:&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;store i32 5, i32* %P&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;br label %Merge&lt;br />&lt;br />BB2:&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;%X = load i32* %P&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ... use %X ...&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; br label %Merge&lt;br />&lt;br />Merge:&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;%Y = load i32 *%P&lt;br />&amp;nbsp; ...&lt;br />&amp;nbsp; ... use %Y ...&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />In this case, GVN scans for available values of %P within the block (starting at the %Y load), and runs into the top of the %Merge block. &amp;nbsp;Since it got to the top of the block, it starts scanning the predecessor blocks (%BB1 and %BB2) and it finds out that the value of the load is 5 in BB1 and %X in BB2. &amp;nbsp;GVN then renames these values with the SSAUpdater class, producing:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>BB1:&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;store i32 5, i32* %P&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;br label %Merge&lt;br />&lt;br />BB2:&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;%X = load i32* %P&lt;br />&amp;nbsp; ... use %X ...&lt;br />&amp;nbsp; br label %Merge&lt;br />&lt;br />Merge:&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;%Y = phi i32 [5, %BB1], [%X,&amp;nbsp;%BB2]&lt;br />&amp;nbsp; ...&lt;br />&amp;nbsp; ... use %Y ...&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />Replacing a load with a PHI node may not seem like a win, however the cost model we use in the LLVM optimizer assumes that PHI nodes will be coalesced away by the code generator, and are thus free. &amp;nbsp;The logic that does PHI insertion is contained and maintained by the SSAUpdater class, which may be the subject of a future Blog post.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-size: x-large;">Pros and Cons of Redundant Load Elimination&lt;/span>&lt;br />&lt;br />We always consider it profitable to eliminate a load in the optimizer when possible. Loads can be quite expensive (e.g. if they miss in the cache), and load/store traffic can hide other redundant or further simplifyable logic from the scalar optimizer. &amp;nbsp;One idiom used to test alias analyses usually looks like this:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;%A = &lt;b>load i32* %P&lt;/b>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;store i32 1, i32* %Q&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;%B = &lt;b>load i32* %P&lt;/b>&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;%C = sub i32 %A, %B&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ret i32 %C&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;br />If GVN + instcombine are able to turn this into "&lt;span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">ret i32 0&lt;/span>" then we know that alias analysis was able to prove that P and Q did not alias. &amp;nbsp;While somewhat unlikely in the real world, this is one example that shows a scalar optimization (X-X == 0) that can not be done unless the redundant loads are eliminated.&lt;br />&lt;br />The cost of eliminating redundant loads is that it creates longer live ranges that the code generator may not be able to cope with. &amp;nbsp;This is a real issue that we don't currently have a good solution for. &amp;nbsp;The ultimate answer is that improved rematerialization will be able to rematerialize the load further down in the code to reduce register pressure, we don't have great support for this yet though.</description></item><item><title>'lit' it</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2009/12/lit-it.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2009 20:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2009/12/lit-it.html</guid><description>
&lt;div>If you've been watching LLVM and Clang, you'll notice that there is a new testing tool we are using called &lt;b>lit&lt;/b>. Clang has already moved to it, and LLVM has support for it (DejaGNU is still the default, but is being phased out). I thought I'd write a little bit about why I wrote &lt;b>lit&lt;/b>, what it is, and how it will make your life better. :)&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>First, let me summarize the pre-&lt;b>lit&lt;/b> background:&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;ul>&lt;li>LLVM used &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/">DejaGNU&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest/">googletest&lt;/a> unit tests. Our usage of DejaGNU was pretty limited though, what we really used was a test format which embedded shell scripts inside each test file. Our DejaGNU harness would interpret those commands, substitute a few variables, run them, and check the exit status. The googletest unit tests were run separately, and frequently forgotten.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Clang used a similar looking -- but completely different -- infrastructure which still had embedded shell scripts, but ran them via &lt;b>make&lt;/b> and &lt;b>sed&lt;/b>. It had the notable advantage of running tests in parallel and being significantly simpler, but not particularly flexible.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;div>One thing both systems had in common was that it was very easy to add a new test, usually a couple lines in a file in the appropriate directory. But there were some annoying cons:&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;ul>&lt;li>There was no way to run tests via CMake or on Windows.&lt;/li>&lt;li>LLVM tests weren't run in parallel.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The UI to the tests was inconsistent and cumbersome (especially for DejaGNU, which would required invoking the LLVM Makefile via a shell script, which then invoked DejaGNU's runtest command).&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;div>I didn't actually set out to write a new testing tool -- &lt;b>lit &lt;/b>started because I had a need to run a very large number of "tests", which was just a fixed script to run with many different inputs. I hacked up a quick multithreaded Python test runner for it, and over time it grew a progress bar and more features. Later, when there was growing interest in having Clang work on Windows I wrote a Python based interpreter for the scripts (remember, they amounted to just shell scripts, so &lt;b>lit&lt;/b> has what amounts to a little (ba)&lt;b>sh&lt;/b> lexer and parser hiding in it). It didn't take a lot of imagination to put the two together and feature creep it until it could replace DejaGNU (yeah, it has a tiny Tcl parser too).&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>So, what &lt;i>is &lt;/i>&lt;b>lit&lt;/b>? Strictly speaking, &lt;b>lit&lt;/b> is a test running infrastructure, like DejaGNU. Its primary job is to find tests, execute them, and report the results to the user; it just happens to have built in support for the LLVM and Clang test formats. My number one design goal was that &lt;b>lit&lt;/b> should "just work" whenever possible -- running a test should be as easy as&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;pre>&lt;b>$ lit exprs.s&lt;/b>&lt;br />lit: lit.cfg:94: note: using out-of-tree build at '/Volumes/Data/ddunbar/llvm.obj.64'&lt;br />-- Testing: 1 tests, 2 threads --&lt;br />PASS: LLVM::MC/AsmParser/exprs.s (1 of 1)&lt;br />Testing Time: 0.06s&lt;br />Expected Passes : 1&lt;br />&lt;/pre>&lt;div>no matter if you are using an in-tree or out-of-tree build, testing Clang or LLVM, a regression test or googletest based unit test, on Windows or Unix, and so on. And of course I also wanted it to be fast!&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>I'm not going to go into more detail on how to use &lt;b>lit&lt;/b> (since it should be self explanatory or documented) but these are some of the features and benefits we've gotten from switching to &lt;b>lit&lt;/b>:&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;ul>&lt;li>LLVM tests run much faster, this improved our buildbot build/test cycle on a fast machine by about 25%, if I recall correctly. I still have a secret desire to make them even faster... one day...&lt;/li>&lt;li>Clang tests work on Windows and have been incorporated into our buildbot. There is still work to be done on LLVM tests.&lt;/li>&lt;li>LLVM/Clang tests work in CMake builds (with Makefiles, Xcode, and Visual Studio generators).&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;b>lit&lt;/b> integrates nicely into buildbot, so individual failures get split out into their own log. I hope to continue to improve the UI for diagnosing failures.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The LLVM googletest based unit tests are seamlessly integrated with the other tests. In fact, when using the standard LLVM Makefiles, its possibly to run all LLVM &amp;amp; Clang tests with just &lt;tt>make check-all&lt;/tt>.&lt;/li>&lt;li>We're using some of the fancier &lt;b>lit&lt;/b> features to help with C++ testing. For example, we have custom test suites which run &lt;tt>clang -fsyntax-only&lt;/tt> over libstdc++ and the LLVM/Clang headers to test the parser, or which run &lt;tt>clang -c&lt;/tt> over the LLVM and Clang C++ code to test Clang's C++ code generation. I secretly suspect Doug of having more &lt;b>lit &lt;/b>test suites hiding on his hard drive.&lt;/li>&lt;li>And I have more improvements in store...&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>&lt;/div>&lt;div>You can read the &lt;b>lit&lt;/b> man page &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/cmds/lit.html">here&lt;/a>, and I hope to add more information to the LLVM &lt;a href="http://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html">Testing Guide&lt;/a> once all the pieces are fully in place. Try it out, I hope you like it!&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>- Daniel&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>p.s. &lt;b>lit&lt;/b> stands for LLVM Integrated Tester, at least thats what I publicly claim. That, or it's the first three letter pronounceable name I came up with...&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Welcome to the LLVM Blog</title><link>https://blog.llvm.org/2009/12/tag-specific-rss-feed.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Dec 2009 10:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.llvm.org/2009/12/tag-specific-rss-feed.html</guid><description>
Welcome to the new and shiny LLVM Blog. &amp;nbsp;We've noticed that while the greater LLVM community active and thriving, that it is very difficult for people who aren't hacking on it to follow interesting developments. A related problem is that the LLVM web page is really old and crufty, and various bits of it were true of some (long ago) time, but which aren't true anymore. This blog is an attempt to fix this problem, by providing a way for people to percolate interesting news out to the world, news that includes a date on it!&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a name='more'>&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;br />My goal is that this blog will talk about the motivation and design of various subsystems in LLVM, including things that don't fit well in either code or permanent documentation, such as "why" we did things a certain way. Beyond the LLVM optimizer and code generator itself, I hope that this will eventually showcase ways that people are using LLVM, as well as details about what is going on in the various sub-projects of LLVM like &lt;a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">Clang&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://dragonegg.llvm.org/">DragonEgg&lt;/a>, etc.&lt;br />&lt;br />A final aspect of this Blog is that we intend to tag posts well and have tag-specific RSS feeds show up on the various subproject web pages. For example, here are some RSS feeds we have so far: [&lt;a href="feed://blog.llvm.org/feeds/posts/default/-/meta">meta&lt;/a>] [&lt;a href="feed://blog.llvm.org/feeds/posts/default/-/optimization">optimization&lt;/a>] [&lt;a href="feed://blog.llvm.org/feeds/posts/default/-/testing">testing&lt;/a>]&amp;nbsp;[&lt;a href="feed://blog.llvm.org/feeds/posts/default/-/Clang">Clang&lt;/a>]. I'd like to have a tag for each subproject as well as (e.g.) a llvm-2.7 tag for features new in the 2.7 release.&lt;br />&lt;br />One decision so far is that we aren't going to allows comments on posts. We don't have the time or inclination to moderate comment spam, and we already have a great forum for discussions: various mailing lists. If you have comments on a post, ideas for future posts, or (better yet!) would like to contribute to this blog, please bring up your ideas on the relevant mailing lists.&lt;br />&lt;br />-Chris</description></item></channel></rss>
